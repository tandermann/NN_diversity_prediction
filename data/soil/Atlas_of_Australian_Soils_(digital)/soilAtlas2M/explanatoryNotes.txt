       where some (Gn2.12) soils may occur also. Bare limestone with some areas of shallow (Uc1.43) sands is
       extensive
AB82  Dune fields--very gently undulating plains dominated by longitudinal dunes; small outcrops of calcrete
       (kunkar) occur in the interdune swales: chief soils are red earthy sands (Uc5.21) with an alkaline soil reaction
       trend and often with calcrete at about 24in. They occur in the swales along with some (Uc5.11) soils.
       Associated are (Uc1.23) soils on the dunes, (Gn2.13) soils in the swales, and (Um5.11) soils on calcrete

       and calcrete (kunkar) at depth. Associated are (Gn2.13) soils; (Um5.11) soils on calcrete outcrops; and
       (Uc1.23) and (Uc5.21) soils on the dunes
AY1 Gently undulating upland (tableland) with much ironstone gravel on the surface; some breakaways (mesas,
          buttes, and bluffs) capped by ironstone (lateritic) duricrust; there is some local marginal transgression by
          longitudinal dunes from adjacent units: chief soils are ironstone-gravelly varieties of shallow red earthy sands
          (KS-Uc5.21) and shallow siliceous sands (KS-Uc1.23), with ironstone duricrust at a depth of about 18 in.
          These soils occur on crest, upper, and mid slopes, generally with (Uc5.21) soils in lower situations and
          (Uc1.23) soils on the dunes. Other soils may occur

          slopes; there are also low escarpments of breccia and laterite; lateritic mesas and buttes; and stone-strewn
          ridges on the interfluves with block laterites; stone and gravel pavements are common; there are occasional
          small tracts of dunes: chief soils are shallow stony and/or gravelly sands and sandy loams (KS-Uc5.21),
          (KS-Uc1.43), and (K-Uc5.21) on the flat to convex upland surfaces. Often these soils are less than 18 in.

          ferruginous duricrust, and red earthy sands (Uc5.21). Associated are (Gn2.11, Gn2.12, and Gn2.13) soils,
          the last two occurring particularly below breakaways, and (Uc5.21) and (Uc1.23) on interdune and dune
          areas respectively, in the broader valleys

          gentle slopes and, in places, abrupt erosional scarps, some granitic bosses, and tors; and irregularly traversed
          by narrow shallow valleys and flats: chief soils are yellow earthy sands (Uc5.22) and sandy yellow earths
          (Gn2.21, Gn2.22) on depositional sites, and ironstone gravels (KS-Uc4.11) together with (Uc4.11) and (Uc2.12),
          both containing ironstone gravels on erosional sites where they are underlain by hardened mottled-zone
          material. Soil dominance varies locally. Associated are shallow valleys and flats of the various (Dy) soils of
          unit Ya28 and pediments of unit Mx41 in the area of Sheet 10; small areas of other soils are likely. This unit
          has similarities with unit Ms8 of Sheet 5. As mapped, areas of adjacent units are included

Fz35 Low hilly lands consisting of numerous dissected lateritic mesas that usually have steep-scarped or benched
          margins, particularly where the siliceous duricrust capping is still preserved. A complex array of soils are
          present, depending on landscape position and degree of dissection; nearly all are covered with siliceous or
          ironstone gravel ranging up to 4 in. diameter, occasionally greater. The soils of the upper slopes probably
          occupy the greater proportion of the unit: these are usually shallow gravelly loams (Um1.43), (K-Um1.43),
          but other mostly shallow gravelly soils (Um4.21), (Uf1.42, Uf1.43), and (Uf6.31) are also common. On
          lower slopes the above soils again occur but there are also important occurrences of shallow to moderately
          deep cracking clays (Ug5.32), (Ug5.22), and occasionally loamy red duplex soils. On outwash fans and
          pediments the soils of unit Oc83 occur. The level surfaces of the larger mesas have loamy red earths

      red duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Dr3.13), and (Dr2.12) occasionally occupy lower sites. Sandy or loamy earths
      (Gn2.41), (Gn2.54), with associated (Gn2.11) and (Gn2.21), occur in narrow valley floors. Data are limited

Fz45  Gently undulating to undulating eroded lateritic plateau with some low lateritic scarps and dissected mesas:
      a range of soils occur in the unit but shallow gravelly loams are probably dominant, chiefly (Um1.43), but
      (Um1.41, Um1.42), (K-Um1.43), and (Um5.51) also occur widely. Associated are a range of shallow to
      moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dr3.32), (Dr2.32), (Dy3.32), (Dy2.32), (Dy1.32), and (Db2.32). In

      (K-Um1.43), with other similar loams (Um5.51), (K-Um5.51) often associated. On lesser slopes deeper
      loams (Um5.51) and loamy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12) occur. On lower slopes and adjacent to drainage
      lines are small areas of loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.32, Dr2.33)
Fz47  Dissected low plateaux with scarps, mesas, and buttes; some gently undulating plateau crests; mottled and pallid

      of steeper relief generally, with porous loamy soils (Um5.51) on areas of gentler relief. Associated are (Gn2.12)
      soils on areas of gentler relief, and (Dr2.33) and (Ug5.2) and (Ug5.3) soils at the base of scarps in small

Fz48 Pronounced scarp ridges with mesas and buttes, and covered with gravels and stones of silicified sandstone;
          leached and ferruginized rock is often exposed on scarp slopes: chief soils are probably shallow stony loams
          (Um1.43) but the soils of unit Nd6 are closely associated, particularly on the remnants of the plateau crests

II1 Flood-plains, terraces, residual islands, lakes: flood-plains, lake bottoms, and some terraces of cracking
           yellow-grey clays (Ug5.28). Associated are undulating to hillocky areas along former, and present, drainage-
           ways of (Ug5.28) and various unclassified and mostly undescribed (Uf) and (Um) soils; "islands" of dunes
           and sand sheets of brown sands (Uc5.13); and residual islands of brown calcareous earths (Gc1) (e.g. of
           unit DD3) and/or crusty loamy soils (Dr1.33) (e.g. of unit Nb4). The above description is slightly expanded
           from that given in Sheet 1, but data remain limited
II3 Alluvial plains associated with major drainage lines; the plains are often dissected by braided stream channels
           and the entire area may be subject to seasonal flooding: dominant soils are deep grey clays with a slight
           (few inches) gilgai microrelief. The chief forms are (Ug5.28, Ug5.24, Ug5.29, and Ug5.25), with lesser brown
           clays (Ug5.34, Ug5.35). Associated are occasional small clay pans with loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33)
II9 Low-lying swampy plains of low rises and shallow channels; some drainage-ways with large water-holes:

           Ug5.24, and Ug5.25). Associated are loamy-surfaced duplex soils (Dy2.13), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.43) and
           deep uniform clays (Uf6.33) often with a scalded surface. Nearer to main channels are other undescribed
           (Uf) and (Um) soils. Data are very limited
II14 Plains subject to inundation after rain: chief soils are deep grey clays (Ug5.28) with (Ug5.5) clays in clay pan
           areas. Other soils may occur
MM5 Gently undulating clay plains with a slight (few inches) gilgai microrelief; where the unit is exposed by stream
           erosion in deep wide valleys the topography may be more strongly undulating and much dissected: brown
           clays (Ug5.32) of moderate depth (30 36 in.) are dominant but similar grey clays (Ug5.26, Ug5.22) are also
           common. The soils often contain much gypsum. In some areas, particularly adjacent to lateritic scarps or
           eroded lateritic mesa-like hills, red-brown clays (Ug5.37, Ug5.38) are locally dominant, together with small
           areas of red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.33). Throughout the unit there are local areas where a veneer of silcrete
           (billy) gravel is prominent. Associated lower-level plains, or small stream flood-plains have deeper clay soils,
           chiefly (Ug5.28, Ug5.29, Ug5.24, and Ug5.34)
MM16 Alluvial plains dominated by deep cracking clays (Ug5.38) along with some areas of (Uf6.71) soils, and
           minor areas of (Dr2.33) soils
MM25 Alluvial plains with many old channels and levees: chief soils are deep brown and grey-brown cracking clays
           (Ug5.34, Ug5.35) and (Ug5.24, Ug5.25), varying locally in dominance. Some uniform non-cracking clays
           (Uf6.31, Uf6.33) also occur. On old channels and levees are deep loamy earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13), with lesser
           (Gn2.42, Gn2.43). Associated with these are areas of loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Db1.13), and (Dy2.13)
           which are often scalded. Some small depressions have massive cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4)
MM26 Alluvial plains with some old infilled channels: dominant soils are deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34, Ug5.35)
          with lesser grey clays (Ug5.25, Ug5.24). Small areas have a weak gilgai microrelief, and in some depressions
          there are massive cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4). The chief soils on stream levees are deep loamy earths
          (Gn2.12), with lesser (Gn2.42) and deep loams (Um5.52). Fringing the clays are loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13),
          (Db1.13), and (Dy2.13) which are often scalded. Some smaller levees have deep uniform clays (Uf6.31)
          and (Uf6.51). Deep sandy red earths (Gn2.13, Gn2.12) occasionally occur in old infilled channels, and there
          are occasionally small gravelly rises with deep loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22)
MM27 Outwash plains subjacent to ranges of basic igneous rocks; some low hills of basic rocks occur in the unit;
          occasional dunes: chief soils are deep cracking clays (Ug5.38) and earthy clays (Uf6.71). Other soils include
          (Um5.52) on the plains, (Um5.11) on low calcrete (kunkar) rises, and (Uc1.23) on the dunes
MM28 Alluvial plains: dominant soils are deep cracking clays (Ug5.38), often in gilgai complex with (Dr1) soils
          such as (Dr1 .33) and (Dr1 .43), both of which have a variable stone and gravel mantle. Associated are (Gn2. 12,
          Gn2. 13) soils which may be locally prominent. Some (Um I ) and (Uc1 ) soils occur also
MM29 Alluvial plains with variable gilgai formation: chief soils are cracking clays (Ug5.3). Associated are some
          (Dr1.33) soils and (Dr4.82) soils
MM30 Plains: chief soils are (Ug5.38) with some (Ug5.6). Small areas of other soils may occur
MM31 Gently undulating to undulating lands with calcareous rock outcrop common on higher slopes and ridge
          crests: dominant soils are the deep brown and grey-brown cracking clays of unit MM5. Associated on higher
          slopes and ridge crests, particularly adjacent to rock outcrop, are a range of shallow loams (Um5.41), (Um5.61),
          (Um5.11), (Um6.22), and (Um1.3) and shallow clays (Uf6.33, Uf6.34) and (Uf6.12, Uf6.13). On some
          slopes there are small areas of calcareous earths (Gc2.21, Gc2.22)
MM32 As for unit MM5 but almost all soils have a veneer of billy or ironstone gravel. Moderately deep to deep
          red crusty uniform clays (Uf6.31) and loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33) with shallow (1-3 in.) A horizons are
          common in areas with heavy gravel cover
MM33 Level alluvial plains with many braided distributary channels: dominant soils are deep brown cracking
          clays (Ug5.34), with other deep cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.25, and Ug5.28) closely associated and in
          some areas locally dominant. Deep uniform clays (Uf6.31, Uf6.33, and Uf6.34) with a scalded and
          crusted surface are also widespread. Small areas of moderately deep cracking clays (Ug5.32) and
          (Ug5.22, Ug5.26) of unit MM5 occur on isolated low rises between stream channels
MM34 Alluvial plains with numerous old infilled channels: dominant soils are deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34),
          with associated deep red-brown and grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.38) and (Ug5.25, Ug5.24). On scalded
          areas and adjacent to stream channels are loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Dr2.43), and (Dr2.33), deep
          uniform clays (Uf6.31), and lesser loamy grey duplex soils (Dy2.13) and (Dy2.33). These soils are often
          gravel-strewn. On stream levees and infilled channels are deep loamy, and occasionally fine sandy, red earths
          (Gn2.13, Gn2.12)
MM35 Alluvial plains with occasional low broad sandy rises: dominant soils are deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34),
          with lesser grey clays (Ug5.28, Ug5.24), and occasional red clays (Ug5.38). In some areas the clays may be
          scalded and have a surface crust up to 1 in. thick. These are tending towards loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33)
          and (Dr2.33). Sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12) occur on the low rises
MM36 Level to very gently undulating plains: dominant and associate soils are as for unit MM35, but in most areas
          all soils have a veneer of billy and ironstone gravel. In areas of heavy surface gravel, loamy red duplex soils
          (Dr2.33) or uniform clays (Uf6.31) may be locally dominant. Occasional areas have a prominent gilgai
          microrelief
MM37 Alluvial flood-plains of major streams with very numerous braided channels; the unit is subject to inundation
          by high floods and most channels are flooded seasonally: dominant soils are deep brown cracking clays
          (Ug5.34), with much lesser grey clays (Ug5.24). In small channels and gutters and seasonally flooded areas
          the soils are self-mulching, but between the braided channels the soils normally have a scalded surface.
          Unit MM38 occupies the smaller tributary flood-plains and throughout the unit there are small areas of
          unit MM41
MM38 Alluvial flood-plains of minor streams; in parts of the unit small braided stream channels are common;
          almost all soils have a scalded surface and in some areas are strewn with small siliceous and/or ironstone
          gravel: dominant soils are deep red-brown or brown cracking clays (Ug5.34), but in parts of the unit, more
          particularly small side valley flood-plains, red cracking clays (Ug5.38) may be dominant. In the lower
          reaches of some flood-plains small areas of deep grey clays (Ug5.24) may occur. Associated throughout
          the unit are small areas of thin-surfaced (1-3 in.) gravel-strewn loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33, Dr2.32)
          together with occasional similar (Dr1) soils
MM39 Alluvial flood-plains with many small distributary channels; throughout the flood-plain are many small
          wind-piled areas of sand and occasional active longitudinal dunes: dominant soils are deep brown cracking
          clays (Ug5.34) with lesser grey clays (Ug5.24). These are often saline with a very soft surface, and in some
          areas small mound springs occur with a prominent salt efflorescence. Adjacent to the sand accumulations
          the clays usually have a variable surface cover of blown sand. The more extensive sand systems have deep to
          moderately deep light brown sands (Uc1.22), occasionally (Uc1.21). More prominent dunes have deep
          reddish sand (Uc1.23)
MM40 Flood-plains of major rivers consisting of very numerous anastomosing small channels and gutters that are
          seasonally flooded and much smaller slightly higher scalded areas between larger channels that are not regu-
          larly flooded: dominant soils of the flooded areas are self-mulching deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34)
          with lesser grey clays (Ug5.24). The scalded areas also have brown clays (Ug5.34) or occasionally grey clays
          (Ug5.24). The unit differs from unit MM37 in that there are fewer deep well-defined channels, a greater part
          is subject to inundation, and there is a much higher proportion of self-mulching soils
MM41 Older alluvial flood-plains of major rivers that are only rarely flooded; the soils all have a severely scalded
          surface and occasionally are slightly gravel-strewn: dominant are deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34),
          with, less commonly, red-brown (Ug5.38) or grey clays (Ug5.24). In some areas there are slightly higher
          gravel-strewn rises with uniform clays (Uf6.31) or thin-surfaced (1-2 in.) loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33).
          Occurring throughout the unit are well-defined shallow drainage lines that are seasonally flooded and
          have self-mulching deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34), less commonly grey clays (Ug5.24). Where the
          unit occurs as part of the flood-plain of the Diamantina River there are some isolated semi-active linear
          sand dunes (Uc1.23)
MM42 Level alluvial plains with occasional drainage channels: dominant soils are strongly self-mulching deep brown
          cracking clays (Ug5.34), with occasional grey-brown clays (Ug5.24) in lower sites. In parts of the unit very
          low gravel-strewn rises occur with red clays (Ug5.38) and (Uf6.31) or occasional thin-surfaced loamy duplex
          soils (Dr2.33)
MM43 Very gently undulating or level plains, usually with dissected very low scarped or benched margins with lime-
          stone outcrop: dominant soils of the plains are deep brown cracking clays (Ug5.34) that have a deep very
          soft and loose self-mulching surface. The soils are often highly gypseous. Associated are similar red-brown
          clays (Ug5.38, Ug5.37), with smaller areas of red-brown uniform clays (Uf6.31) that are often gravel-strewn.
          At the dissected margins of the unit the soils are shallow and highly calcareous, the chief forms are (Um5.61),
          (Um5.11), (Um1.3), and (Uf6.12)
MM44 Gently undulating plains with many low ridges with limestone outcrop: dominant soils are shallow to moder-
          ately deep red or red-brown clays (Ug5.37), with lesser deep red clays (Ug5.38). Associated soils are brown
          and grey-brown clays (Ug5.32) and (Ug5.22) of unit MM5. A range of shallow uniform calcareous clays
          (Uf6.31) and (Uf6.12, Uf6.13) and loams (Um6.32, Um6.34), (Um6.23, Um6.24), (Um1.3), (Um5.61), and
          (Um5.11) occur on the areas of limestone outcrop
MM45 Undulating plains with broad ridge crests and long gentle slopes; more extensive level plains also occur:
          dominant soils are moderately deep to deep red or red-brown clays (Ug5.37), with brown clays (Ug5.32)
          often associated. Also occurring, particularly in lower sites, are deep red, red-brown, or brown clays (Ug5.38,
          Ug5.34). The clay soils may be slightly gravel-strewn. Throughout the unit there are many slightly higher
          rises with gravel-strewn loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.13) and (Dr2.33) and red uniform clays (Uf6.31)
MM46 Alluvial plains with some slightly higher scalded areas that are often gravel-strewn: dominant soils are deep
          red-brown cracking clays (Ug5.38), with associated deep brown (Ug5.34) or occasionally grey (Ug5.24)
          cracking clays in lower sites. In some areas the clays are slightly gravel-strewn. On the low rises and adjacent
          to streams are gravel-strewn loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33), (Dr2.43), and (Dr2.13) and occasional uniform
          clays (Uf6.31). Crusty duplex soils (Dr1.33) and (Dr1.43) may also occur. On some stream levees are deep
          loamy or occasionally sandy red earths (Gn2.13, Gn2.12)
MM47 Gently undulating plains, often strewn with siliceous or ironstone gravel: dominant soils are deep red-brown
          or red cracking clays (Ug5.38), with lesser areas of brown clays (Ug5.34). Locally there are small areas of
          grey clays (Ug5.24) with a slight gilgai microrelief. In some localities marginal to the unit, there are areas of
          red calcareous earths (Gc2.21, Gc2.22) and occasional low limestone ridges with shallow calcareous loams
          (Um5.61)
MM48 Level or very gently undulating plains; the soil surface may be strewn with small siliceous or ironstone gravel:
          dominant soils are deep red-brown cracking clays (Ug5.38), occasionally (Ug5.37), with lesser deep brown
          clays (Ug5.34) associated. In slightly depressed areas deep grey clays (Ug5.24) occur. On slightly higher
          rises silicified limestone may outcrop; and the soils are brown calcareous earths (Gc2.22, Gc2.21) and
          (Gc1.12) or shallow calcareous loams (Um5.61) and (Um6.23)
MM49 Gently undulating to undulating lands with some isolated low lateritic mesas: dominant soils are probably
          deep red cracking clays (Ug5.38), but also common are areas of brown and grey-brown clays (Ug5.34) and
          (Ug5.24) with lesser areas of similar moderately deep clays (Ug5.37, Ug5.32) and (Ug5.22). Associated are
          loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33) and uniform clays (Uf6.31) which may be locally dominant. All soils have a
          veneer of siliceous and ironstone gravel. The low mesas included in the unit are small outliers of unit Fa42.
          Data are limited
MM50 Gently undulating lands with some areas of prominent gilgai microrelief. Dominant and associate soils are
          as for unit MM49
MM51 Undulating lands with many lateritic mesa remnants with steep scarped margins. Dominant and associate
          soils are as for unit MM49. Data are limited
MM52 Gently undulating plains with very broad ridge crests and long slopes; the soils usually have a variable surface
          strew of billy gravel: dominant are deep red or red-brown clays (Ug5.38), with lesser deep brown clays (Ug5.34);
          these occur more commonly as small alluvial plains associated with drainage lines. Throughout the unit
          there are numerous gravel-strewn areas, devoid of vegetation, with thin-surfaced (1-3 in.) loamy red duplex
          soils (Dr2.32, Dr2.33) and red uniform clays (Uf6.31). In some areas there are very low eroded mesa remnants
          of unit Fz46 with shallow stony (Um1.43) soils
MM53 Broadly undulating lands with gentle slopes to the drainage lines; the soil surface has an almost continuous
     cover of billy gibbers (silcrete) up to 4 in. diameter, occasionally greater: dominant soils are deep red-brown
     or red cracking clays (Ug5.38), less commonly (Ug5.37). Occasionally there is a slight (few inches) gilgai
     microrelief. Closely associated are similar stony-surfaced loamy red duplex soils with thin A horizons
     (1-3 in.); the common form is (Dr2.32) but occasionally (Dr2.33) and similar (Dr1) soils also occur. Drainage
     lines have small alluvial plains with scalded red-brown or brown deep cracking clays (Ug5.34) and occasionally
     (Ug5.38); these soils are often stone-free. In parts of the unit are small low mesas of unit Qc1O, too small
     to map separately. This unit is very similar to unit Qc9 but clay soils are much more prominent    
MM54 Old alluvial flood-plains that are mostly not subject to flooding; the surface soil is usually severely scalded:  :      dominant
     soils are deep red or red-brown cracking clays (Ug5.38), but deep brown clays (Ug5.34) occur in
     those parts of the unit that are subject to seasonal flooding. Locally, there are small sandy plains or old
     stream levees of red earthy sands (Uc5.2), and occasional relict low dunes of (Uc1.23) sands. Adjacent
     to the sandy areas and stream channels there are small areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.13), uniform loams
     (Um6.24), and occasional loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33)
MM55 Very gently undulating plains with a slight gravel-strewn surface; in some areas a continuous cover of small
     (1/2 -1 in.) ironstone gravel may be present: dominant soils are deep red-brown cracking clays (Ug5.38) and     
     occasionally (Ug5.37). On some gravel-strewn areas, red uniform clays (Uf6.31) or thin-surfaced (1-2 in.)
     loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.32) may occur. Adjacent to drainage lines there are small flood-plains of deep
     brown clays (Ug5.34) with a strongly scalded surface
MM56 As for unit MM52 but the soils usually have an almost continuous surface cover of small ironstone gravel and
     there is probably a higher proportion of red uniform clays (Uf6.31) and loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.33,
     Dr2.32)
MM57 Very gently undulating to strongly rolling downs with low mesas and buttes of calcareous sandstones; locally,
     gravels may cover the surface, but large areas do not have a gravel cover: dominant soils are brown cracking
     clays (Ug5.32, Ug5.34, Ug5.37, and Ug5.38). Other soils include (Uf6.33) on mesas and buttes and (Ug5.24)
     in some drainage-ways. There are similarities with unit MM5. Minor inclusions of unit Nd2 may occur
     in places

Qa26 Gently undulating lands: dominant soils are gravelly-surfaced moderately deep to deep red duplex soils
            (Dr2.12, Dr2.13), with occasional (Dr2.43) and (Dr2.33). Associated are loamy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12)
            that often have gravel and ironstone nodules in the profile. Other duplex soils (Db1.13), (Dy2.13), (Dy2.33),
            and (Db1.33) also occur, associated with small areas of deep cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.25)
Qa27 Gently undulating to undulating lands with some granite tor outcrop: dominant are gravelly-surfaced shallow
            red duplex soils (Dr2. 12, Dr2. 11), with lesser (Dr2. 13). Associated are sandy red earths (Gn2. 11 ) and shallow
            loamy sands (Uc4.22) and (Uc4.11, Uc4.12)

            shallow to moderately deep loamy red duplex soils with thin A horizons (2-4 in.). The chief form is (Dr2.32),
            but (Dr2.12) and similar alkaline soils also occur, the latter being more common adjacent to drainage lines.
            Associated on higher sites are loamy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12), while deep cracking red or brown clays
            (Ug5.38, Ug5.34) occur on small level plains in lower sites

            or red clays (Ug5.38), occasionally (Ug5.37, Ug5.34) and (Uf6.31) which are usually less stony. The clays
            commonly occupy the small depressions where a slight (few inches) gilgai microrelief is present. Associated
            drainage lines have small alluvial plains with scalded red-brown or brown deep cracking clays (Ug5.34),
            occasionally (Ug5.38); these soils are often stone-free. In parts of the unit are small low mesas of unit

            areas and the depressions have less stony-surfaced red or red-brown cracking clays (Ug5.38). On some
            broader plateau surfaces the clays may be locally dominant. The more gently sloping margins of the mesas
            also have stony (Dr2.32) soils, but where steep benched slopes or scarps occur the soils are shallow very stony

          are shallow loamy red duplex soils (Dr3.22), with lesser (Dr3.42, Dr3.41) and (Dr2.22). Other loamy duplex
          soils (Dy3.42, Dy3.41) and (Dy2) equivalents, together with loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21, Gn2.24), occur
          on the lower slopes, outwash fans, and in the drainage lines. Shallow gravelly loams (Um4.2) and sands
          (Uc4.2) and (Uc4.12) occur on the ridge crests. Data are fairly limited

LL1 Hills and plains--multicyclic erosional landscape of hills and hillocky areas with intervening plain-like
             areas, the whole traversed and dissected by variously incised stream valleys--some layering of soil
             materials: (i) relatively higher hills and ranges of loamy soils having an A2 horizon (Um4.2) and
             yellow-brown earths (Gn2.44) with (Um5.41 and Um5.S1), many stones, and rock outcrops; gullies
             of (Dr2) and (Dy3.32 and Dy3.42) soils; (ii) relatively lower hills and hillocky areas of hard acidic
             red soils (Dr2.21) and (Uc6.11), (Um) soils and rock outcrops with (Dy3.4) soils on lower slopes and

             horizons and other (Uc) and (Um) soils; (v) also remains of various soil materials such as ironstone

             to be the (D) soils as a group but their variety is such that no single (D) soil can, on present data,
             be regarded as dominant

           massive surface horizon. Associated are: on the plains and swamps, friable loamy soils (Um6) or
           friable earths (Gn3 or Gn4) or (Uf6) soils (available soil descriptions are inadequate); river levees
           of hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) and hard alkaline dark mottled soils (Dd2.33); sandhills of (Uc1.2)

           (Dr2.33) and (Db1.33) with other (D) soils as found in unit Oc12. Other features include small areas
           of unit B10 and possibly small areas of red earths (Gn2.13) as for unit Mx5. There is some local
           variation in soil dominance between the (Ug5) and the (D) soils. This unit may represent a broad
           transition between units Oc12 and CC17
CC17 Plains of slightly gilgaied (few inches) cracking clays associated with major and minor functional and
             non-functional drainage-ways: chief soils are grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25) and brown clays
             (Ug5.34 and Ug5.35). Associated features and soils are: many small, low domes or rises (often levee
             banks) related to old drainage-ways, with soils of units B10, Si2, and Ro3 north of about the Col-
             larenebri-Moree line, and of unit Oc12 south of about this line--note that these low domes may
             give rise to apparent toposequences of soils locally; small areas of (Dd1.33 and Dd1.43) soils along
             the eastern margins of this unit; some areas of dark clays (Ug5.15 and Ug5.16) especially in the
             Moree-Narrabri localities and possibly related to adjacent elevated basalt areas; some undescribed
             (?U) soils on recent terraces and flood-plains along some present streams; some repeatedly flooded
             areas with grey clays (Ug5.S) having a massive surface; and some swamps and marshes with unde-
             scribed soils. Portions of this unit may be flooded seasonally
CC18 Plains of slightly gilgaied (few inches) cracking clays associated with major and minor functional
             drainage-ways: chief soils are grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25) and brown clays (Ug5.34, Ug5.35,
             and Ug5.38). Parts of this unit may be flooded seasonally. Also included are: low wind-deflated
             domes of red and brown crusty loamy soils (Dr1.33 and Dr1.43) and (DbO.33) frequency of occur-

             terraces, levees, etc. along some major streams. It is likely that this unit represents a transition from
             unit CC17 to unit CC19. Boundaries are approximate

             non-functional drainage-ways: chief soils are grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25) and brown clays (Ug5.38
             and Ug5.34), the dominance of grey and brown varying locally. Also included are small swampy
             basins of (Ug5.24) soils and possibly (Ug5.S) soils. As mapped, some clay pans (unit Nb3), sand
             dunes (unit B12), and red earths (unit Mx1) are included. Portions of this unit may be flooded
             seasonally
CC20 Gently undulating cracking clay plains with moderate to strong (2-4 ft) gilgai microrelief: chief soils
             are deep grey clays (Ug5.24) with smaller areas of (Ug5.25 and Ug5.28) and some brown clays
             (Ug5.34). Soil reaction values of these cracking clays vary and comprise alkaline or neutral surfaces
             with acid subsoils (common), acid throughout (fairly common), and alkaline throughout (rare).
             In some areas (Dy2.33 and Dy2.43) soils occur on the slightly raised flat areas between gilgai depressions
             or adjacent to small drainage lines. As mapped, small areas of units B10, MM1, and Ro4 are
             included in Queensland, and unit Ro1 in the Narrabri area of New South Wales

        yellow-grey clays (Ug5.28). Associated are undulating to hillocky areas along former and present
        drainage-ways of (Ug5.28) and various unclassified and mostly undescribed (Uf) and (Um) soils;

        earths (Gc1) (e.g. of unit DD3) and/or crusty loamy soils (Dr1.33) (e.g. of unit Nb4). This description
        is slightly expanded from that given in Sheet 1 but data remain limited
II2  Former lake beds and flood-plains: cracking yellow-grey clays (Ug5.2), probably (Ug5.28), in association
        with low eroded and scalded mounds and lunettes of crusty loamy soils (Dr1.33 and Dr1.43) or their
        remnants. Incomplete data

             chief soils are deep brown clays (Ug5.34) with some (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.38). Commonly associated
             are loamy surfaced (Dr2.33) and (Db1.33) soils, and small areas of red earths (Gn2.12)

             and (Ug5.16) with some melon-hole microrelief. Associated are friable yellow mottled soils (Dy5.1),
             and well-drained sandy levee soils (not described). As mapped, small islands of adjacent units are
             included
DD3  Plains with melon-hole microrelief in places, tracts of dunes, box flats: plains and dunes of brown
        calcareous earths (Gc1.12), (Gc1.22), (Gc2.12). Associated are: small areas of low dunes with sandy
        earths (Gn1.13) and possibly other (Gn1) soils; lower-lying situations generally with crusty loamy
        soils (Dr1.33); some pronounced dunes of brown sands (Uc5.1); and box flats with undescribed
        soils. The clay substrata below these soils generally occur at shallow depths towards the northern
        portion of the unit, which is extremely complex, and could be subdivided if more data were available.
        See Sheet 1 also
DD5  Plain with low dunes: brown calcareous earths (Gc1.12 and Gc1.22) with sandy earths (Gn1.13) in

        of cracking grey clays (Ug5.2)
Mz1  Gently undulating to hilly: three groups of soils are common--red earths (Gn2.11 and Gn2.12); hard
        red soils (Dr2.21, Dr2.22, and Dr2.33); and red friable earths (Gn3.12 and Gn3.13). Dominance

        Mo5 are included
Mz2  Flat to gently undulating (?terrace remnants): red earths (Gn2.11 and Gn2.12) on flat to gently undu-
        lating areas. Associated are red friable earths (Gn3.12 and Gn3.13) in the vicinity of basalt-strewn

        broken by some steeper hilly areas: chief soils are neutral red earths (Gn2.12) mantled by siliceous
        and/or ironstone gravels. Associated are ridge crests and low hills of shallow loams (Um1.43),
        (Um5.41), and other (Um) soils, boulders, and rock outcrops; limited areas of gravel-free red earths
        (Gn2.12 and Gn2.13) in the relatively lower-lying sites (valleys); and soils of units CC19 and/or

        and yellow earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.22). Associated are some shallow loams (Um1.43) on ridge
        crests; and hard-setting loamy soils with yellow clay subsoils (Dy2.43) in the broad flats, where
        small areas of soils of adjacent units also occur
My3 Gently undulating plains with occasional high ridges and cuesta-like scarps: chief soils of the gently
           sloping to flat areas are red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13, and Gn2.11) with some yellow earths (Gn2.2),
           all often with a surface scattering of ironstone gravel; on the higher ridges and scarps shallow loams
           (Um1.43) occur with some ferruginous rock outcrops, while in the lower-lying situations (Dr2.33)
           soils occur along with small areas of soils of adjacent units
My4 Gently undulating plains with dunes and occasional low stony ridges: extensive level areas of sandy
           and loamy red earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.13) with lesser areas of yellow earths (Gn2.21 and Gn2.22)

Mo8 Dissected basaltic plateau--generally low hilly: chief soils are neutral red friable earths (Gn3.12).
             The area is generally similar to unit Mo7 although the cracking clays (Ug5) are not so extensive;

Mn1 Basaltic ridges and knolls with some steep rocky slopes and in places some gentle convex slopes: chief
             soils seem to be alkaline red friable earths (Gn3.13) and friable neutral red soils (Dr4.12). Associated

             situation seem to be acid red friable earths (Gn3.14), generally as follows: high terraces of acid red
             friable earths (Gn3.11 and Gn3.14), and/or friable acidic red and red mottled soils (Dr4.21) and

             locally; other loamy soils such as (Um5.2); present flood-plain deposits of (Uc1.2) and/or (Um1.21)
             soils. Adjoining slopes have soils of units Tb43 and to a lesser extent Ta7. As mapped, small areas

             in any given locality
Mj3 Hilly with deep dissection but with some remnants of the old gently undulating landscape, some hillside
             creep: chief soils are acid red friable earths (Gn3.14) in the relatively wetter sites, and hard acidic
             red soils (Dr2.21) in the relatively drier sites--it is not clear which of these soils is the more common.
             Associated are: various (Dy) soils such as (Dy5.S1) and (Dy4.11) in the wetter areas and (Dy3.21)
             and (Dy3.41) in the drier areas; some yellow (Gn) soils such as (Gn3.84) in the wetter areas; and

             rock outcrops, hillside creep: chief soils are acid red friable earths (Gn3.14) and hard acidic red
             soils (Dr2.21)--generally the former seem dominant in the western and wetter portions* of the unit
             and the latter in the eastern and drier portions, but no clear boundary is evident and much of the
             unit covers rather inaccessible country. Associated soils are (Um4.2), (Dy3.21), and (Dy3.41) in the
             eastern and drier portions; and (Dy5.S1) and (Dy4.11) in the western and wetter portions, where

        horizon (Um4.2) with yellow-brown earths (Gn2.44); stream valleys of various soils including
        (Dy4.41) (Dy5.41), and (Um6.11). This unit is a broad one. In some areas the (Dy) and (Dr) soils
        with the (Um4.2) and the (Gn2.44) soils are.dominant rather than the (Gn3) soils

               acidic red soils (Dr2.21), and yellow leached friable earths (Gn3.54); and narrow incised stream
               valleys of various soils including (Um6.11) and (Dy) soils. This unit is a broad one. In some
               areas the (Um4.2) and (Gn2.44) soils and in others the (Dy) and (Dr) soils rather than the (Gn3
               soils could be dominant
Me3 Undulating to hilly basaltic ridge: chief soils are brown friable earths (Gn3.22) with (Um6) soils, such
               as (Um6.21), and with dark cracking clays (Ug5.15) in the lower-lying situations

                   in the Liverpool Range area. The full range of soils is not known and therefore the dominant soil
             is doubtful
Mf4  Mountainous--steep to very steep ridges generally with narrow crests and thickly colluviated in places,
               ravines, gorges, rock outcrops, and hilly valleys along major streams: chief soils are acid yellow

               soils; and minor occurrences of other undescribed soils. The whole area is traversed by narrow valleys
               of variable soils, largely undescribed, but including (Um6.11) on terraces and (Dg4) and (Dy5) on
               flood-plains. As mapped, small but significant areas of unit Mg24 are included in the N.S.W.

Oc1 The following description is slightly modified from that given for unit Oc1 on Sheet 2; it includes unit
                 P1 of Sheet 1. Plains with low sand-hills, prior streams, depressions, swamps, and present stream
                 valleys. Layered soil and sedimentary materials below the sola of present-day soils are important
                 factors in soil variability owing to their influence on drainage characteristics: chief soils are hard
                 alkaline red soils (Dr2.33), other (Dr2) and (D) soils with grey and brown cracking clays, commonly
                 (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.35). The detailed soil pattern is complex: the relatively higher, better-drained
                 portions of the plains have hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.23 and Dr2.33) and smaller areas of other
                 soils including (Dr2.]2) and (Dr3.23); the relatively intermediate portions of the plain have (Dr2.33)
                 in association with hard alkaline brown soils (Db1.33 and Db1.43) and gilgai puffs of cracking clays
                 (Ug5.2 and Ug5.3) in some places, small areas of other soils include (Dr2.43) and (Dr3.43); the
                 relatively lower portions of the plains, depressions, and swampy areas have hard alkaline yellow
                 mottled soils (Dy3.43 and Dy3.33) in association with cracking clays (Ug5.2), (Ug5.4), (Ug5.5),
                 (Ug3.2), often in gilgai formation; low sand-hills have deep sandy neutral red mottled soils (DrS.62)
                 and (Uc1.2) soils; prior streams have very variable "well-drained soils" in the stream bed and
                 (Dr2.23, Dr2.33, Dr2.43), or shallow varieties of (Gn2.13) soils on their levees which may merge
                 with the relatively higher portions of the plain; present stream valleys have flood-plains of (Dy3.4),
                 (Gn), and (Um) soils. As mapped, areas of unit CC3 may be included

             red soils (Dr2.33), grey and brown cracking clays, commonly (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.35), and other (D)

             seasonal flooding of (Ug5.2), (Ug5.3), (Db1.43), (Dy2.43), (Dd1.33 and Dd1.43), and (Ug5.4) soils;

               in the Murrurundi area. To the south-east it grades into unit Tb42, the boundary between the two
               units is indefinite

Fq1    Alluvial fan plain dissected by numerous active and prior stream channels: soils are extremely variable
       over short lateral distances but all have uniform or weakly gradational texture profiles. The dominant
       soil of the inter-channel areas is a uniform silt loam (Um3.2), often with older buried soils at shallow

          chiefly grey clays (Ug5.22 and Ug5.23) but with important areas of dark clays (Ug5.13 and Ug5.14)
          or brown clays (Ug5.32). A slight (6 12 in.) gilgai microrelief may occasionally be present and local
          surface accumulations of silcrete (billy) gravel may occur. Associated soils are mainly loamy duplex
          soils (Dy2.33 and Dy2.13), (Dd1.33 and Dd1.13), and (Db1.33 and Db1.13). On higher ridges and their
     slopes friable earths (Gn3.43 and Gn3.46) and uniform friable clays (Uf6.31, Uf6.32, and Uf6.33)
     occur together with (Gn3.93) in low sites. The soils of associated stream flood-plains are loamy duplex
     types (unit S14). There are a few small inclusions of unit Fz6
CB4   Broadly undulating lands with occasional high ridges or low flat-topped hills: dominant soils are cracking
     clays of moderate depth (2-3 ft), chiefly grey (Ug5.22 and Ug5.23) with smaller areas of brown clays            
     (Ug5.32). In some areas a slight or moderate gilgai microrelief may be present (1-2 ft). Associated are         
     higher ridges with loamy red duplex soils (Dr2. 12 and Dr2. 13) and smaller areas of (Db1.13) and (Dy2.33).  
     These soils are mostly shallow and may be stony. Densely vegetated low hills or high ridges occurring
     in the unit have shallow stony clays (Uf6.31), (Uf6.33), and (Ug5.12). On the lower slopes of such areas        
     friable earths (Gn3.93), (Gn3.13), and (Gn3.23) occur. Throughout the unit small alluvial valley plains
     occur with deep clay soils (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25) and (Ug5.15 and Ug5.16)                                          
CB5    Gentle to moderately undulating and rolling lands with some broad plains and low hills and ridges:
     chief soils are grey clays (Ug5.22 and Ug5.23) with locally important areas of dark clays (Ug5.13 and           
     Ug5.14) or brown clays (Ug5.32). Some gilgai microrelief may be present and also some local accumula-           
     tions of silcrete (billy) gravel may occur. Deeper grey and brown clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34) occur             
     on the broader plains. Various loamy duplex soils such as (Dy2.33), (Dd1.33), (Db1.33), and (Dr2.13)            
     are present locally. On higher ridges and their slopes soils common to unit Mm11 are likely                    
CB6    Moderately undulating lands with widely spaced shallow valleys: dominant soils are shallow to moderately
     deep grey clays which often have a prominent linear gilgai on slopes. The chief forms are (Ug5.22)
     and (Ug5.23), but brown clays (Ug5.32, Ug5.33, and Ug5.37) and dark clays (Ug5.13) also occur.
     In valley floors deeper clays occur (Ug5.24), (Ug5.16), and (Ug5.34). Widely occurring on ridge crests          
     and stronger slopes are thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Db1.13), (Dr2.13), (Dr2.12), (Dy2.13),       
     (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.43). These duplex soils often have a surface strew of small gravel fragments

     grey clays of moderate depth are dominant, usually with pronounced linear gilgai. The chief forms are           
     (Ug5.22) and (Ug5.23), with lesser areas of (Ug5.13) and (Ug5.32). In lower sites and on associated
     small alluvial plains deep clay soils occur, chiefly (Ug5.25), (Ug5.16), (Ug5.15), and (Ug5.24). On the         
     broad ridge crests shallower brown or red-brown clays (Ug5.32 and Ug5.37) are prominent, together
     with thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Dr2.12), (Dy2.13), and (Db1.13). Also occurring
     in the unit are small alluvial plains of loamy duplex soils (Db1.33), (Dd1.33), and (Dy2.33), and
     occasional low basaltic hills with shallow stony soils (Uf6.32), (Uf6.31), (Ug5.12), and (Um6.31)

     clays (Ug5.32). Some deep clay soils (Ug5.24) also occur and these usually have a moderate gilgai
     microrelief. Closely associated and often occurring as linear bands are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33),
     (Dy2.43), (Db1.13), (Db1.33), (Db1.43), and less commonly (Dr2.13 and Dr2.12)

     non-functional drainage-ways: chief soils are grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25) and brown clays (Ug5.34
     and Ug5.35). Associated features and soils are: (i) many small low domes or rises (often levee banks)
     related to old drainage-ways, with soils of units B10, Si2, and R03 north of about the Collarenebri-
     Moree line (Sheet 3) and of unit Oc12 south of about this line--note that these low domes may give rise
     to apparent toposequences of soils locally; (ii) small areas of (Dd1.33) and (Dd1.43) soils along the
     eastern margins of this unit; (iii) some areas of dark clays (Ug5.15 and Ug5.16), especially in the

     non-functional drainage-ways: chief soils are grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25) and brown clays (Ug5.38          
     and Ug5.34), the dominance of grey and brown varying locally. Also included are small swampy basins
     of (Ug5.24) soils and possibly (Ug5.5) soils. As mapped, some clay pans, unit Nb3, sand dunes, unit          
     B12, and red earths, unit Mx1, are included. Portions of this unit may be flooded seasonally

     are deep grey clays (Ug5.24) with smaller areas of (Ug5.25) and (Ug5.28) and some brown clays (Ug5.34).       
     Soil reaction values of these cracking clays vary and comprise: (i) alkaline or neutral surfaces with         
     acid subsoils (common); (ii) acid throughout (fairly common); and (iii) alkaline throughout (rare).           
     In some areas (Dy2.33) and (Dy2.43) soils occur on the slightly raised flat areas between gilgai depressions
     or adjacent to small drainage-lines. As mapped, small areas of units B10, MM1, and Ro4 are included
     in Queensland, and unit Ro1 in the Narrabri area of New South Wales (Sheet 3)

      (Db1.33). These occur either on slightly higher landscape sites or as small alluvial plains fringing
      drainage lines. Also occurring are small areas of friable earths (Gn3.23) and (Gn3.93); and occasional
      areas of loamy red earths (Gn2. 11) may be included in the unit as mapped. The cracking clays have the

      and mostly subject to irregular flooding: dominant soils are deep grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.25)
      with smaller areas of black or brown clays (Ug5.15) and (Ug5.34); in certain areas the clays may be

       brown clays (Ug5.32) on gilgai puffs and cracking grey clays (Ug5.23) in gilgai depressions. Associated
     are cracking grey clays (Ug5.25) at the foot of slopes and in the intervening valleys, and minor occurrences
     of unit HG1 soils on the lower slopes of some ridges
MM4  Undulating plains: dominant soils are brown clays (Ug5.32 and Ug5.37) with a very slight (few inches)
     gilgai microrelief; this is linear on slopes. A surface gravel strew may occur. Associated soils include
     deeper brown or grey clays (Ug5.38) and (Ug5.24) and some (Ug5.12) and (Ug5.22). Adjacent to                   
     most drainage lines and lateritic mesas are red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.33). Similar (Db1) soils
     also occur                                                                                                     
MM5  Gently undulating clay plains with a slight (few inches) gilgai microrelief; where the unit is exposed by
     stream erosion in deep wide valleys in the north-west corner of Sheet 4, topography may be strongly
     undulating and much dissected: brown clays (Ug5.32) of moderate depth (30 36 in.) are dominant                 
     but similar grey clays (Ug5.26 and Ug5.22) are also common. The soils often contain much gypsum.               
     In some areas, particularly adjacent to lateritic scarps or eroded lateritic mesa-like hills, red-brown        
     clays are locally prominent (Ug5.37 and Ug5.38), together with small areas of red loamy duplex soils
     (Dr2.33). Throughout the unit there are local areas where a veneer of silcrete (billy) gravel is prominent.    
     Associated lower-level plains or small stream flood-plains have deeper clay soils, chiefly (Ug5.28),           
     (Ug5.29), (Ug5.24), and (Ug5.34). Occasional small low lateritic mesas (unit Fz5) may occur in the unit        
MM6  Gently undulating or almost level plains: dominant soils are brown clays (Ug5.32 and Ug5.34) with
     important areas of grey clays (Ug5.22 and Ug5.24) and smaller areas of dark clays (Ug5.12). A slight           
     (6-12 in.) gilgai microrelief may be present and some areas may have a surface veneer of silcrete (billy)      
     gravel. The chief associated soils are loamy duplex soils (Db1.13 and Db1.33) and (Dd1.13 and Dd1.33).  
     Small stream flood-plains have (Dy2.43) soils
MM7  Moderate to gently undulating lowlands and plains: dominant soils are moderately deep to deep clays,           
     which in some areas have a moderate gilgai microrelief (1-2 ft). In some areas the soil surface may be
     strewn with silcrete (billy) gravel to 4 in. diameter. Brown clays (Ug5.34, Ug5.38, Ug5.32, and Ug5.37)       
     are dominant but grey forms (Ug5.25, Ug5.24, and Ug5.22) are also common; dark clays (Ug5.13,                  
     Ug5.15, and Ug5.16) also occur. Closely associated are thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dr2.13       
     and Dr2.33), (Db1.13 and Db1.33), and (Dy2.33 and Dy2.43), which occur particularly on flood-plains
     of small streams. Small areas of friable earths (Gn3.13 and Gn3.12) also occur, particularly where the
     unit borders the high mountains of unit Bz1                                                                    
MM8  Gently undulating or level plains: dominant soils are brown or grey cracking clays with a moderate             
     to strong gilgai microrelief (2-4 ft). Chief soils are (Ug5.34), (Ug5.38), (Ug5.32), and (Ug5.24) with
     some dark clays (Ug5.15). Some areas may be strewn with silcrete (billy) gravel to 4 in. diameter.
     Closely associated are small areas of thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Db1.13), (Db1.33), (Dd1.13),
     and (Dr2. 13). Soil reaction values of the cracking clays (Ug5) vary and comprise: (i) alkaline or neutral
     surfaces with acid subsoils (common); (ii) acid throughout (fairly common); and (iii) alkaline throughout
     (rare)                                                                                                         
MM9    Terraced valley plains: chief soils are brown and grey cracking clays (Ug5.34), (Ug5.39), and (Ug5.2)
       which occur on the third terrace with (Gn3.21), (Dy3.41), and (Dy3.13) soils. Associated are: (Gn3.42
       and Gn3.43) soils on the second terrace, with (Ug5.15), (Ug5.16), and (Ug5.24) soils on back slopes,
       (Dy2.22) soils on sandy levees, and smaller areas of (Dd1.52), (Ug6.11), (Um6.22), (Db1.13), and
       (Db2.41); and (Uc) soils common on the first terrace and on lateral fans. Buried soils occur throughout.
       As mapped, small areas of adjoining units may be included
MM10   Moderate to gently undulating lowlands and plains broken by high strike ridges and hills: chief soils
       are brown clays (Ug5.34, Ug5.38, Ug5.32, and Ug5.37), with grey clays (Ug5.25, Ug5.24, and Ug5.22)        
       and dark clays (Ug5.13, Ug5.15, and Ug5.16). Associated are loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Dr2.33),        
       (Db1.13), (Db1.33), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.43) on flood-plains along small streams, and the soils of unit
       If3 on the narrow strike ridges and hills                                                                 
MM11   Broadly undulating or level plains: dominant soils are deep brown clays (Ug5.34), with lesser red-brown   
       (Ug5.38) and grey clays (Ug5.24). All are non-gilgaied or with only a very slight (6 in.) microrelief.    
       Marginal to the unit are small areas of brown or red loamy duplex soils (Db1.13 and Db1.33) and (Dr2.13                   
       and Dr2.33)                                                                                               
MM12 Alluvial plains, sometimes with slight to moderate (1-2 ft) gilgai microrelief: dominant soils are brown
       deep clays (Ug5.34) with lesser grey clays (Ug5.25 and Ug5.24). Associated are many small areas           
       with thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Db1.13 and Db1.33) and lesser similar (Dy2) soils                  
MM13   Undulating or level plains, occasionally with slight to moderate gilgai microrelief (1-2 ft): dominant    
       soils are brown clays of moderate depth (Ug5.33 and Ug5.32) associated with similar grey clays (Ug5.22,
       Ug5.23, and Ug5.24). Included in the unit, as mapped, are small areas of red-brown friable earths
       (Gn3.12); deeper clay soils (Ug5.25), (Ug5.15), and (Ug5.34); some small low basaltic hills with shallow
       stony (Um6) and (Uf6) soils; and small alluvial plains with loamy duplex soils (Db1.33), (Dd1.33),
       and (Dy2.33)
MM14   Rolling landscape of very low rounded hills with gentle side slopes passing to gently sloping fans and
       alluvial flats: chief soils are brown cracking clays (Ug5.35 and Ug5.38), but dark (Ug5.16) and grey
       (Ug5.24) forms have local importance. There is a moderate development of melon-hole type microrelief.
       Associated are (Gn3.11 and Gn3.12) soils on the low hills. Minor soil occurrences include gilgai
       complexes of (Gn3.21) on banks and (Gn3.91) in depressions, and of (Dy2.43) on banks and (Gn3.9)
     in depressions; and (Gn3.22) on basal hill slopes. As mapped, hills of unit Sk8 are included, as is a
     singular trachyte plug with (Uc2.12) soils
NN2  Level alluvial marine plains adjacent to tidal flats; the unit may be inundated for short periods by
     flood waters and partly by very high tides: dominant soils are massive heavy clays (Ug5.4) with closely
     associated (Ug5.5), (Uf6.41), (Uf6.42), (Uf6.32), and (Uf6.33); thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils
     (Dd2.13) and (Dd2.33); and similar (Dd1) and (Dy2) soils. Small areas of self-mulching clays (Ug5.16)
     and (Ug5.24) occur in lower sites and in slight gilgai depressions. At their coastal margins the marine
     plains merge into salt pans with (Uf6.61) and other undescribed saline soils. These also occur adjacent
     to the many small tidal channels that dissect the marine plains. At the inland margins the unit grades to
     loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43)
Mz3  Undulating lands with occasional low lateritic scarps: dominant soils are loamy slightly acid deep
     red earths (Gn2.11). Some similar sandy red earths also occur; higher marginal slopes may also have
     deep sandy duplex soils (Dy5.41) and (Dy5.81), and the low lateritic scarps have shallow gravelly loams
     (Um1.43). Some valley floors may have small flood-plains of deep dark clays (Ug5.15) derived from an
     adjacent unit (Kb11)
Mz4  Narrow low hilly cuesta-like range: dominant soils are sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.11) with some
     yellow earths (Gn2.21) on flatter crests. Shallow stony loams (Um1.43) are closely associated,
     particularly with scarps. The marginal lower dip slopes often have deep sands (Uc1.21) and (Uc2.22)
     and sandy-surfaced mottled duplex soils (Dy5.41) and (Dy3.42)
Mz5  Undulating to gently undulating elevated plains often bounded by steep lateritic scarps, smaller residual
     occurrences of the unit often occur as scarp-bordered low mesas: dominant soils are slightly acid loamy
     red earths (Gn2.11) which may occasionally contain nodular gravels. Associated are smaller areas of
     loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21, Gn2.22, Gn2.24, and Gn2.64) containing nodular gravels. The lateritic
     scarps have a range of shallow stony soils, chiefly (Um1.43), (Dy3.41), (Dy3.42), (Dr3.41), and
     occasionally (Uc2.12). Some flat ridge tops have (Dy2.43) soils with acid clays below 30 in. In broad
     valley floors and on some lower slopes loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.42 and Dy3.43) occur. Small
     stream flood-plains also have loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43)
Mz6  Undulating or very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are loamy red earths (Gn2.11 and Gn2.12)
     with slightly smaller areas of yellow earths (Gn2.21 and Gn2.22). In some yellow earth areas a sink-hole
     gilgai microrelief may be associated--the puffs and flatter areas have loamy-surfaced duplex soils
     (Db1.13) and (Dy3.13) while in deeper depressions rusty-mottled clays (Ug5.24) occur
Mz7   Rolling country with broad rounded rises passing into low hilly terrain in places: chief soils are red
      earths (Gn2.11). Associated are (Dy3.41) soils with some lateritic gravels on mid to lower slopes,
      and some (Dr2.21) soils on mid slopes. Minor soil occurrences include (Dy2.21) and (Db1.13) on slopes
      above the adjoining plains, and (Gn2.24) containing lateritic gravels on upper slopes
Mz8   Plateaux with a rolling to low hilly surface, some minor scarps; dissected steep slopes around margins
      of the plateaux: chief soils are red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12, and Gn2.14) with sandy to loamy surfaces;
      some are snuffy and some contain much lateritic gravel. In places smooth-faced pedal clays occur at
      depth below the red earths. Associated are (Gn3. 11) soils on gully slopes under softwood, and (Dy3.41)
      and (Dy5.81) also on dissection slopes. Small areas of other soils include (Dr2.41), (Gn3.74), (Um4.1)
      (Um2.12), and (Gn3.91)

      and dissected remnants of unit Mz8: chief soils are snuffy and ironstone gravelly red earths (Gn2.11,
      Gn2.12, and Gn2.14) on mesa tops and gentle colluvial slopes. Associated are (Dy3.41) and (Dr2.41)
      soils below scarps and on gentle slopes, and gravelly (Um2.12) soils on stripped rounded crests. Minor

      some rougher hills with rock outcrops in dissected areas bordering the mesas: chief soils are deep snuffy
      red earths (Gn2.11), some containing lateritic nodules and gravels. Associated are (Um6.13) soils             
      containing lateritic material on the crests of some mesas, (Gn3.11) soils in valleys bordering the mesas,     
      and (Ug5.14) and (Gn3.43) soils on dissection slopes. Minor soil occurrences include (Um2.12) on stony        
      crests with outcrops, and (Dr2.4) soils on dissection slopes

      acid deep sandy red earths (Gn2.11), occasionally (Gn2.12). Associated are sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21),
         mostly with a nodular ironstone layer at moderate depths, and red and yellow earthy sands (Uc5.21
         and Uc5.22). As mapped, smaller areas of similar loamy red and yellow earths are also included
Mz14 Alluvial fan plain with many old slightly elevated (2-3 ft) sand-filled channels: dominant soils are deep
          slightly acid sandy red earths (Gn2.11), with lesser (Gn2.12). The sand-filled channels have deep sands
          (Uc1.23 and Uc1.22) and deep earthy sands (Uc5.21 and Uc5.22). Also occurring in the association
          are small areas of sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21 and Gn2.22)
Mz15 Undulating to gently undulating lands with some high ridges and occasional low lateritic scarps. A
          complex array of soils is present, depending mainly on landscape position. The dominant soils, which
          tend to occur on higher landscape sites, are loamy red earths (Gn2.11), which often contain an ironstone
          nodule horizon. Also occurring on upper slopes are loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22), associated with
          other earths (Gn2.84) and (Gn2.64). Lower slopes and valley floors mostly have loamy duplex soils
          (Dy3.42 and Dy3.43), with lesser (Dy2.43 and Dy2.42). On some high non-lateritic ridge crests sandy
          to loamy acid duplex soils (Dy3.41) occur, associated with lesser (Dy5.41) and (Dy5.81). The low

          smaller areas of loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42)
Mz17 Undulating lands with occasional lateritic scarps and low mesas: dominant soils are slightly acid loamy
          red earths (Gn2. 11) which often contain many ironstone nodules at depth. Associated are neutral loamy
          red earths (Gn2.12), and lesser loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22 and Gn2.25). The soils of the scarps and
          mesas are loamy red earths (Gn2.12) on the more extensive surfaces, elsewhere shallow stony loams
          (Um1.43) and (Um4.1) are common. On scarp slopes and in local depressions loamy duplex soils
          (Dy3.43) and (Dy2.43) occur. Marginally the unit may grade into or be closely associated with red
          and brown cracking clays (Ug5.38) and (Ug5.34), which have slight to moderate gilgai microrelief
Mz18 Gently undulating plateau surface, often bounded by steep lateritic scarps where marginally dissected:
          dominant soils are deep slightly acid loamy red earths (Gn2.11), with some small marginal areas of
          loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21). The marginal lateritic scarps have shallow red earths (Gn2. 11) and stony
          loams (Um1.43) and (Um4.1), also less commonly (Uc2.12). Elsewhere the margins of the unit have the

          1700 ft above sea level)--broken by some steeper hilly areas: chief soils are neutral red earths (Gn2. 12)
          mantled by siliceous and/or ironstone gravels. Associated are: (i) ridge crests and low hills of shallow
          loams (Um1.43), (Um5.41), and other (Um) soils, boulders, and rock outcrops; (ii) limited areas of
          gravel-free red earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.13) in the relatively lower-lying sites (valleys); and (iii) soils
          of units CC19 and/or Nb3 along drainage-ways
My3 Gently undulating plains with occasional high ridges and cuesta-like scarps: the chief soils of the gently
          sloping to flat areas are red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13, and Gn2.11) with some yellow earths (Gn2.2),
          all often with a surface scattering of ironstone gravel. On the higher ridges and scarps shallow loams
          (Um1.43) occur with some ferruginous rock outcrops, while in the lower-lying situations (Dr2.33) soils
          occur along with small areas of soils of adjacent units

          with smaller areas of yellow earths (Gn2.22) and hard-setting loamy soils with red clay subsoils (Dr2.33).
         The low dunes or occasional more-extensive sandy areas have deep siliceous sands (Uc1.2) or, less
         commonly, earthy sands (Uc5.2); associated lower-lying areas have strongly gilgaied cracking clays
         (Ug5.24 and Ug5.28) interwoven with (Dr2.33), (Dr2.43), and (Dy2.33) soils

          Gn2.11) with some yellow earths (Gn2.22 and Gn2.21). Associated are deep red sands (Uc1.23 and
          Uc1.22), often in the form of low dunes. Broad shallow drainage lines often have loamy duplex soils
          associated, chiefly (Dy3.42), (Dy2.42), or (Dr2.32). In other depressed areas shallow red earths are
          underlain by a clay D horizon. Small areas of clay soils (unit Ii1) may be included
My20 Level or very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are loamy red earths (Gn2.12) with some loamy
          yellow earths (Gn2.22). Lower landscape sites have a range of loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dr2.43),

          Small flood-plains associated with drainage lines have (Dr2.33) and (Dd1.33) soils, and occasionally
          some low sand dunes (Uc1.21, Uc1.22, and Uc1.23)
My21 Undulating elevated plains with some steep-scarped dissected margins and occasional low mesa-like
          residual hills: dominant soils are loamy red earths (Gn2.12) with some yellow earths (Gn2.22) and
          (Gn2.42). Some lower sites have gilgaied grey clays (Ug5.24) or brown clays (Ug5.34) that are non-gilgaied
My22 Gently undulating alluvial plains fringing major drainage lines: dominant soils are loose sandy red
          earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.11). Associated are old sandy levees and occasional low dunes with deep
          sandy soils (Uc5.21) and (Uc5.11). Marginally included in the unit are sandy or loamy-surfaced mottled
          duplex soils (Dy5.41) and (Dy3.42)
My23 Level mesas or tablelands of considerable extent and with steep-scarped margins; dissected lower hilly
          lands often with alluvial terraces and fans; some low hilly eroded mesa remnants: dominant soils of
          the extensive tablelands and mesas are loamy red earths (Gn2. 12) with some (Gn2. 11) and lesser yellow
          earths (Gn2.22). Some shallow stony loams (Um1.43) and (Um5.2) occur, particularly near scarped
          margins where they may be underlain by massive laterite. The dissected areas have mostly loamy
          duplex soils (Dy2.33), (Dy2.43), (Db1.13), and (Db1.33), with occasional areas of (Dr2.13) or cracking
          clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34). Outwash fans mostly have (Db1.33) or (Dy2.43) soils
My24   Gently undulating plains with occasional high ridges: dominant soils are sandy and often gravelly
    red earths (Gn2.12) with lesser (Gn2.11) and (Gn2.22). Closely associated are sandy duplex soils with
    moderately deep A horizons and hard clay subsoils (Dy3.42 and Dy3.43). In lower sites are thin-surfaced
    loamy duplex soils (Dd1.13) and (Dd1.33) or gilgaied cracking clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.16)
My25   Level or very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are deep sandy red earths (Gn2.12), occasionally
    (Gn2.11). Associated are similar sandy yellow earths (Gn2.22) and small areas of deep red sands
    (Uc1.23) and (Uc5.21). Also occurring are some loamy red and yellow earths (Gn2.12) and (Gn2.22)
    and occasional low lateritic scarps with shallow stony loams (Um1.43). Shallow drainage lines occurring
    in the unit have loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy2.43)
My26   Gently undulating or level plains: dominant soils are hard loamy red earths (Gn2.12) and yellow earths
    (Gn2.22), (Gn2.32), and (Gn2.62). The red and yellow earths may vary locally in dominance, the
    former occurring mainly on slightly higher sites. Associated broad shallow drainage lines have loamy
    duplex soils, (Dy3.33) and (Dy3.43), similar (Dy2) soils, and small areas of (Dr2.13). Also included
    in the unit are some low laterite or sandstone scarps with shallow stony loams (Um1.43), and occasional     
    eroded mottled rock pavements
My27    Level or very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are deep loamy red earths (Gn2.12), occasionally
    (Gn2.11). Slightly higher low broad ridges often have loamy or sandy yellow earths with a nodular
    ironstone horizon at shallow depths (Gn2.22), (Gn2.21), (Gn2.24), and (Gn2.62). In broad shallow            
    drainage depressions loamy yellow earths may also occur, associated with limited areas of loamy duplex
    soils (Dy2.42) and (Dy3.42). The red earth plains may be bounded by scarped margins with shallow stony
    loams (Um1.43) and mottled rock outcrops
My28    Gently undulating lands with broad ridge crests and low rises: dominant soils are loamy or occasionally
    sandy red earths (Gn2.12), less often (Gn2.11). Associated are lesser loamy or sandy yellow earths
    (Gn2.22). On lower slopes and in drainage depressions loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43 and Dy3.42), and
     similar (Dy2) soils occur. Occasionally present are low lateritic scarps with shallow stony loams (Um1.43)
    and (Um4.1). Included in the unit, as mapped, are small areas of gilgaied cracking clays similar to
    units CC21 and CC33
My29   Level sandy plains with some slightly depressed scalded areas: dominant soils are sandy red earths
     (Gn2.12) and occasionally sandy yellow earths (Gn2.22) and (Gn2.42). At the margins of the unit
        duplex soils (Dr2.12 and Dr2.13), (Dr3.12 and Dr3.13) occur. The bare clay pan areas have eroded
        duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), (Dr2.43), (Dr2.33), (Db1.43), and (Db1.33), or occasionally very
        shallow loams (Um1.43) overlying mottled rock
My30  Very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are loamy red earths (Gn2.12), occasionally (Gn2.11),
        with lesser loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22) that are mostly nodular. In some areas erosion has exposed
        a hard mottled rock pavement with very shallow loams (Um1.43). Adjacent to drainage lines are small
        areas of red duplex soils (Dr2.33) or cracking clays (Ug5.24)
My31  Level plains with occasional very slightly higher old sand-filled stream channels: dominant soils are
        sandy red earths (Gn2.12), with lesser (Gn2.11). Also commonly occurring, more particularly in the
        sand-filled channels, are red and yellow earthy sands (Uc5.21 and Uc5.22) together with other sand
        soils (Uc1.23 and Uc1.22). In slightly depressed areas loamy duplex soils may occur, chiefly
        (Dr2.33), (Dr2.43), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.43). Other soils in the unit include small areas of loamy and
        sandy yellow earths (Gn2.22 and Gn2.21) and other red earths (Gn2.15 and Gn2.14)
My32  Level alluvial fan plain: dominant soils are soft loamy or sandy red earths (Gn2.12) with lesser (Gn2.11).
        In many areas old sand-filled distributary channels occur, now slightly elevated above the plain. These
        have deep sands (Uc1.23) or earthy sands (Uc5.21 and Uc5.22). Throughout the unit small scalded areas
        are common with loamy red earths (Gn2.12) or duplex soils (Dr2.32 and Dr2.33). Other loamy earths
        occurring in the unit are (Gn2.35), (Gn2.95), and (Gn2.22)
My33  Gently undulating plains or low broad ridges and some swampy depressions: dominant soils are sandy
        red earths (Gn2.12) with sandy or loamy duplex soils occurring in lower sites (Dy3.42 and Dy3.43),
        and similar (Dy2) soils. Small areas of gilgaied cracking clays (unit CC30) occur in some low sites,
        associated with (Dy2.33) soils
My34  Gently undulating plains, locally with stronger relief: dominant soils are loamy red earths (Gn2.12),
        with lesser (Gn2.11). Loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22) are commonly associated. Both earths are
        commonly strongly nodular at depth and in some instances are underlain by massive nodular laterite
        at shallow depths (15-20 in.). Broad shallow drainage-line valleys in the unit have loamy duplex soils
        (Dy2.43) and (Dr2.43); and small local depressed areas may have gilgaied clays (Ug5.24). At the dissected
        margins of the unit gravelly duplex soils (Dr2.33) and (Dr2.13) are common
My35  Undulating lands, often with high gravelly ridges: dominant soils are loamy or sandy red earths (Gn2.12
        and Gn2.11) that are often gravelly. Lesser areas of yellow earths (Gn2.22) occur on lower slope sites.
        The high gravelly ridges have either sandy red earths (Gn2.12), extremely gravelly sandy soils (Uc5.11),
        (Uc1.21), and (Uc1.23), or stony loams (Um1.43) and (Um4.1). Occurring throughout the unit, mostly
        in lower sites, are small areas of loamy duplex soils (Db1.13), (Db1.33), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.43), or
        gilgaied clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34)
My36 Gently undulating plains, sometimes with dissected scarped margins and some low sandstone mesas:
          dominant soils are deep sandy red earths (Gn2.12), with lesser (Gn2.11), which may contain quartz
          gravel at depth. Associated are smaller areas of loamy red earths (Gn2. 12 and Gn2. 11) and deep sandy
          duplex soils (Dy5.81). The dissected margins of the unit and the sandstone mesas have mostly shallow
          stony sands (Uc4.11), (Uc1.21), and (Uc2.12)
My37 Undulating basalt plains and plateaux with many low stony rises and occasional low conical hills. The
          soil surface ranges from stone-free (rarely) to a frequent occurrence of basalt boulders and stony outcrop
          (most common). The dominant soils are loamy red earths of shallow to moderate depth (18-40 in.)
          that commonly have some large basalt boulders in the profile. The chief forms are neutral (Gn2.12),
          but slightly acid forms (Gn2.11) are also common, particularly the shallower soils. In most soils small
          ironstone nodules occur throughout, and deeper soils may tend to have smooth-ped structure at depth.
          Small areas of friable earths (Gn3.12 and Gn3.11) occur locally. Low stony basalt rises commonly
          occurring throughout the unit have very shallow stony (Um5.51) soils. Also occurring in the unit are
          slightly lower areas of loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21), (Gn2.61), and (Gn2.24); these may be locally
          dominant in some areas. Also included in the unit are some small stony plains of dark cracking clays 
          (unit Kb24) that are too small to map separately. The more easterly extent of this unit has larger areas 
          of gently undulating plains that have fewer low stony rises and flow scarps. However, the soils nearly
          always have variable amounts of basalt boulders on the surface and throughout the profile. Yellow earths
          (Gn2.21), (Gn2.61), and occasionally (Gn3.21), tend to be more prominent in this area
My38 Very gently undulating outwash fan-plains from unit JJ12: dominant soils are deep sandy red earths 
          (Gn2.12) with lesser (Gn2.11), (Gn2.16), and (Gn2.42); however, other sand soils (Uc1 .23 and Uc1.21)
          are also common. Associated are a range of sandy or loamy duplex soils (Dy2.22), (Dr2.22), (Db1.33),
          and (Dy3.43). Small areas of clay soils of units CB7 and MM13 are included in this unit, as mapped
My39 Undulating low rises that are old levees of major streams: dominant soils are loamy or sandy red earths
          (Gn2.12), occasionally with some yellow earths (Gn2.22) near the margins. Occurring in the unit,
          as mapped, are shallow drainage lines subject to flooding; these have uniform loamy soils (Um5.5) or,
          less commonly, clays (Ug5.24)
My40 Gently undulating plains, often occurring as a plateau surface with steep-scarped margins: dominant
          soils are deep loamy red earths (Gn2.12), with lesser (Gn2.11). In slightly lower sites loamy yellow
          earths (Gn2.22) may occur, associated with small areas of loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42). The scarped
          margins have shallow loams (Um1.43) or (Um4.1) underlain by lateritic materials, mostly mottled rock
Mx1   Gently undulating plains with low dunes and occasional low stony ridges: extensive level areas of sandy
      and loamy red earths (Gn2.}3 and Gn2.12) with smaller areas of yellow earths (Gn2.22 and Gn2.21),
      broken by occasional low rises of red earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.13) mantled with siliceous gravel, or
      higher ridges with shallow loams (Um1 .43). Associated are: (i) dunes of variable frequency of occurrence
      with sandy red earths (Gn2.13 and Gn2.12), red earthy sands (Uc5.21), brown sands (Uc5.1), or siliceous
      sands (Uc1.2); and (ii) drainage lines of cracking clays (Ug5.2 and Ug5.3) with clay pans of (Dr1.33)       
      and (Dr1.43) soils                                                                                         
Mw21  Low hilly terrain on shales and soft sandstones with gently sloping flat-topped to broadly convex rises,
      gentle to moderate side slopes, and open shallow valleys: chief soils are acid leached red earths (Gn2.14)
      on the slopes. Associated are (Dr3.21) and (Dr2.21) soils on upper slopes and (Dy3.41) soils on mid
      and lower slopes. Other soils include (Gn3.93), (Gn2.94), and (Dy2.41) soils along stream valleys,          
      (Db1.32) and (Um6) soils on andesitic dykes, and possibly (Gn3.11) soils on some of the higher flat-        
      top areas. Small areas of unit Tb69 are included

      soils are acid leached red earths (Gn2.14). Associated are (Gn3.84) soils on the slightly lower portions    
      of the plain. Other soils include (Gn2.94) in depressions, (Dy3.41) on slopes above stream valleys,
      and (Uc2.21) and (Gn2.74) along the stream valleys                                                          
Mw23  Rolling land of red and yellow sandy alluvia with gently sloping to flat crests, and gentle to moderate     
      side slopes to shallow valleys with narrow flats: chief soils are red earths (Gn2.14) on the crests.

      (Gn2.91), and (Gn2.94) along stream flats, and (Dy2.41) and (Dr3.41) on shale areas. As mapped,             
      valleys of unit Tb69 are included                                                                           
Mw24  Hilly to low hilly landscape on sandstone; narrow sharply convex hill crests with moderate to steep         
      slopes to narrow alluvial flats; some rock outcrops; many soils are moderately deep to deep and
      prone to erosion: chief soils are red earths (Gn2.14) on platforms and mid and lower slopes, and their
      shallow gravelly variants on ridge crests. Associated are (Uc4.2) soils on ridge crests, (Dy5.21) soils on   
      hill slopes, and (Dr5.21) soils on slopes of high hills. Minor soil occurrences include (Gn2.44) and        
      (Uc4.11) on crests and upper slopes. As mapped, "valleys" of unit MF4 and plateau remnants of               
      unit Mm9 are included                                                                                       
Mw25  Plateau areas between 400 and 1200 ft above sea level: chief soils seem to be acid leached red earths       
      (Gn2.14) and possibly (Gn2.11) with red friable earths (Gn3.11). Some (Uf6.31) soils occur on basalt
Mw26  Strongly undulating lands with some high narrow ridges, low dissected mesaS, and steep-scarped low
      cuestas: dominant soils are deep sandy red earths (Gn2.14) that are occasionally gravelly. On higher
      more dissected landscape sites are shallow stony loams (Um1.43), and lower flatter slopes mostly have
      deep sandy-surfaced duplex soils (Dy3.42) and (Dy5.42). Data are fairly limited
Mw27   Plateaux and mesas with gently undulating surfaces and steep-scarped dissected margins: dominant
     soils are deep sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.14), less often (Gn2.11), with some areas of deep red
     sands (Uc4.2). Also occurring are small areas of sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21). The more eroded
     mesas have shallow stony sands (Uc4.11) and (Uc2.12) formed on altered sandstone on the higher sites,
     together with some areas of (Dg2.81), (Um4.1), and (Um2.12). On lower slopes and outwash fans
     sandy or loamy duplex soils are common, chiefly (Dy5.42) and (Dy3.42)
Mw28    Undulating elevated plains with gently sloping margins: dominant soils are deep sandy red earths
     (Gn2.14). At the margins of the unit sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21 and Gn2.22) occur together with sandy      
     duplex soils (Dy3.42) and leached sands (Uc2.12) and (Uc2.34)                                               
Mw29   Strongly rolling lands with broad smooth crests and broad concave depressions: dominant soils are
     sandy red earths (Gn2.14 and Gn2.11) on broad gently sloping crests and, in places, underlain by            
     water-worn gravel at 3-5 ft in depth. Associated are: (Dy3.41) soils on mid to upper slopes; (Gn2.34),
     (Gn2.24), (Dr3.21 ), and (Dr3.41 ) soils on shoulders of broad rises and some smaller crests; and (Dy3.43)  
     and (Dy2.43) soils in the broad depressions and on lower slopes. Minor soil occurrences include (Dy4.81),

Mw30   Gently undulating area of tertiary sediments and igneous rocks: chief soils are red earths (Gn2.14)     
     with associated areas of red friable earths (Gn3.11). Other soils are (Ug5.13), (Ug5.14), (Gn3.42),
     and (Gn3.22) on basalt                                                                                      
Mu10 Undulating dissected lands with occasional low hills: a range of sandy earth soils occurs but (Gn2.15) 
          is probably dominant. Associated are sandy yellow earths (Gn2.22, Gn2.21, and Gn2.25) and smaller
          areas of grey leached earths (Gn2.94). The occasional low hills have shallow gritty sands with some
          granite outcrop (Uc2.12) and (Uc2.21). These are inclusions of unit Ca16. Drainage lines occurring
          in the unit have small alluvial plains of loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.43). The latter may
          also occur on some lower slopes. Data are limited
Ms2 Very gently undulating or level plains: dominant soils are slightly acid sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21)
          with lesser (Gn2.22). Ironstone nodule layers often occur at moderate depths. Closely associated
          are yellow earthy sands (Uc5.22) and areas of deep sandy red earths (Gn2.11 and Gn2.12). Small areas
          of loamy red and yellow earths also occur and broad shallow drainage depressions have sandy-surfaced
          duplex soils (Dy3.32, Dy3.42, and Dy3.43) or other earth soils (Gn2.95) and (Gn2.35). Small low hilly

Ms3  Level or very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are slightly acid sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21)
     with associated (Gn2.22, Gn2.24, and Gn2.25). A prominent ironstone nodule horizon is normally
     present by 36 in. In slightly lower sites and particularly in broad shallow drainage lines leached earths
     (Gn2.34) and (Gn2.94) are common, again often with an ironstone nodule horizon. Also occurring
     in the unit are smaller areas of earthy sands (Uc5.22) and sandy and loamy red earths (Gn2.11 and           
     Gn2.12). In better-defined drainage lines duplex soils are common, chiefly (Dy2.43), (Dy2.32), (Dy3.42),
     and (Dy3.43)                                                                                                
Ms4  Moderate to gently undulating lands with some low lateritic scarps: dominant soils on higher landscape
     sites are loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21), (Gn2.24), and (Gn2.62) with occasional areas of red earths          
     (Gn2. 11). In valley floors and lower slopes loamy duplex soils occur, chiefly (Dy3.42). The low lateritic
     scarps have shallow stony loams (Um1.41) or sands (Uc2.12)
Ms5  Gently undulating extensive plateau surface with dissected low scarped margins: dominant soils are          
     slightly acid loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21) with lesser (Gn2.61). A prominent ironstone nodule horizon      
     is often present at moderate depths. In some areas a sink-hole type gilgai microrelief is present, with
     (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.43) soils occurring in the depressions. Adjacent to shallow drainage lines are loamy     
     duplex soils (Dy3.43 and Dy3.42); these are often underlain by mottled rock. The dissected margins          
     of the plateau include soils of units Tb1 19 and Cd14
Ms6  Undulating lands with broad shallow depressions: dominant soils of the higher landscape sites are
     loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21) and (Gn2.61). On lower slopes loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.42)
     occur and in the broad depressions (Dy2.43) soils are most common. Included in the unit, as mapped,
     are small inclusions of unit Cd17 and small areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12)
MS1  Gently undulating or level plains: dominant soils are sandy or, less commonly, loamy yellow earths
     (Gn2.22), occasionally (Gn2.21 and Gn2.24). These soils are mostly underlain by nodular or concre-
     tionary laterite at shallow to moderate depths and occasionally outcropping. Closely associated are
     sandy to loamy red earths (Gn2.12) and (Gn2.42), which are much deeper. In broad shallow drainage
     lines loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy2.42), (Dy3.33), (Dy3.43), and (Dy3.42) occur. Throughout
     the unit are small areas of earthy sands (Uc5.22)
MS2  Gently undulating or level plains: dominant soils are loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22) with some (Gn2.21),
     (Gn2.62), (Gn2.25), and (Gn2.32). Most soils have a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at moderate
     to shallow depths (18-30 in.). Closely associated and locally dominant are areas of hard loamy red
     earths (Gn2.12), less commonly (Gn2.11); these may or may not have an ironstone horizon. Much
     smaller areas of sandy red and yellow earths may occur locally. Broad shallow drainage lines have loamy
     duplex soils (Dy2.33), (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), and (Dr2.13), or occasionally small areas of gilgaied cracking
     clays (Ug5.24). Outcrops of lateritic materials (billy and porcellanite) may occur with very shallow
     stony loams (Um1.43) and sands (Uc4.12)
MS3  Level or very gently undulating outwash plains dissected by numerous small shallow prior stream channels,
    some of which are sand-filled: the dominant soils of the higher landscape sites are deep sandy yellow earths
    (Gn2.22) with lesser (Gn2.25) and (Gn2. 12). In most drainage depressions loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22)
    and (Gn2.35) or grey earths (Gn2.95) occur, but in better-defined old channels loamy duplex soils
    (Dy3.32), (Dy3.33), and (Dy2.43) occur. The sand-filled channels have deep sands (Uc1.22), (Uc1.23),
    and (Uc5.22)
MS4   Gently undulating plains: dominant soils are sandy or occasionally loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22) and
    (Gn2.62). Very small areas of sandy red earths (Gn2.12) are associated. Near the sloping margins
    of the unit the yellow earths are underlain by a strongly developed ironstone nodule horizon. In lower        
    sites throughout the unit loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.43) occur together with            
    occasional small areas of grey cracking clays (Ug5.24)
MS5   Level plains with many broad very shallow lake-like depressions: dominant soils are loamy yellow
    earths (Gn2.22), lesser (Gn2.21), with some areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.11). In many          
    of the yellow earths nodular or massive nodular laterite occurs at relatively shallow depths (15-20 in.).
    The shallow depressions have cracking clays with a slight sink-hole-type gilgai (Ug5.24). Marginal
    to the depressions are loamy duplex soils (Dy2-33) and (Dy3-33)                                            
MS6   Undulating low plateaux, often with low scarped margins: dominant soils are loamy yellow earths
    (Gn2.22), often with a prominent ironstone nodule layer at shallow depths. Associated are smaller
    areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.11), and some shallow stony loams (Um1.43) on exposed           
    lateritic (mottled rock) materials. On lower gentle slopes loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.42) and      
    (Dy3.32) commonly occur, and in lower sites brown or grey loamy duplex soils are common (unit Ro10)      
MS7  Very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are sandy or, less commonly, loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22
    and Gn2.25), with lesser loamy red earths (Gn2.12). Closely associated are slightly depressed areas
    with grey cracking (Ug5.25, Ug5.24, and Ug5.29) clays of unit CC38. Marginal to the small clay plains
    are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), and (Dy3.42)
MS8    Gently undulating plains with broad shallow drainage depressions: a wide range of loamy yellow earths
    and related soils occurs but (Gn2.22) is probably most common. On higher landscape sites (Gn2.21,
    Gn2.24, and Gn2.25) are commonly associated. In slightly depressed areas (Gn2.35), (Gn2.95), (Gn2.34),
    and (Gn2.55) all may occur locally. All of these earth soils commonly contain a horizon of ironstone
    nodules at 30 36 in. and occasionally at shallower depths. In the broad shallow drainage depressions
    loamy duplex soils occur, chiefly (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), and (Dy3.42), together with some grey leached
    earths (Gn2.95) and (Gn2.85). Also occurring in the unit as mapped are very small areas of loamy red
    earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.11) and small inclusions of slightly gilgaied clays (Ug5.24)
MS9 Extensive gently undulating elevated plains often bounded by low dissected scarp margins: dominant
       soils are loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22) with lesser (Gn2.25 and Gn2.24), which almost always have a
       prominent ironstone nodule layer at depths ranging from 20 to 30 in. In some areas the yellow earths
       are underlain by a strongly pedal clay D horizon at moderate depths (18-24 in.). In slightly depressed
       areas in the unit grey earths occur, chiefly (Gn2.82), while adjacent to drainage lines are loamy duplex
       soils (Dy3.42 and Dy3.43). Loamy red earths (Gn2.1) occur on small low rises and there are also small
       inclusions of unit Sl21. Adjacent to the scarped margins are shallow stony sands or loams (Uc2.12),
       (Um1.43), and (Um4.1), usually underlain by lateritic materials
MS10   Moderately undulating lands: dominant soils are loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22) on the higher parts of
       the landscape and loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42 and Dy3.43) on lower slopes and valley floors. Small
       areas of leached grey earths (Gn2.94 and Gn2.95) also occur. Also associated in the unit are small
       areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12) and red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.12) and (Dr2.22)

       are areas of nodule-free earthy sands (Uc4.2) and (Uc5.22), together with some areas of sandy or loamy
       red earths (Gn2.11 and Gn2.12)

          earths (Gn3.23) and (Gn3.13) also occur and the gently sloping plains usually have areas of brown
          clays (Ug5.32) with, less commonly, grey clays (Ug5.22). Other loamy duplex soils occur chiefly in

      rarely (Db1.43). Similar (Dr), (Dd), and (Dy) soils are commonly associated. In many instances the
      deeper subsoils may be extremely acid. A slight (few inches) gilgai microrelief is often present and cracking
      clays (Ug5.3 and Ug5.2) may then occur as soil complexes. As mapped, small areas of units CC20,
      Wa13, Fz2, and MM2 are also included
Ro5  Undulating lands: dominant are brown loamy duplex soils (Db1.33), (Db1.23), and (Db1.43), often
      with gravelly A horizons. Associated are red duplex soils (Dr2.33) and (Dr2.23), and small areas of
      cracking clays (Ug5.32) and (Ug5.22). Other alkaline duplex soils with bleached A2 horizons also occur,

Ro6  Strongly undulating or low hilly lands with a low benched or scarped topography caused by more resistant
      horizontal rock outcrop: the soils are all shallow, sometimes gravel-strewn or with frequent rock
      outcrops; they often alternate over short distances. Dominant are brown loamy duplex soils (Db1.33),
      (Db1.43), and (Db1.13) but closely associated are similar (Dd1) and (Dy2) soils. Small areas of similar
      (Dr2) soils also occur. Higher ridges and low hills often have shallow stony loams (Um2.12) and
      (Um1.43) while drainage lines in the unit have small flood-plains of deeper loamy duplex soils, chiefly
      (Dy2.43)
Ro7  Undulating or small level plains dissected by many small drainage lines: dominant are brown loamy
      duplex soils (Db1.33) and (Db1.13), but similar (Dr2) soils are commonly associated. Many areas

      deep (18 in.) sandy A horizons overlying brown clay (Db1.33) and (Db1.23). Associated are similar
          (Dr2.33) and (Dr2.43) soils together with areas of thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and
          (Dy2.33), and similar (Dy3) soils. The occasional sandy dunes have deep sands (Uc1.23) and (Uc5.21),
          or sandy red earths (Gn2.12). As mapped, the unit also includes some of the clay pan soils of unit Sl13
Ro9 Undulating lands with some high flat-topped or steep stony ridges: dominant on the flatter areas are brown
           loamy duplex soils (Db1.33), (Db1.13), and (Db1.43) with commonly associated similar (Dy2) soils.
           Small areas of cracking clays (Ug5.22), (Ug5.24), and (Ug5.34) also occur in lower sites and occasionally
           are slightly gilgaied (1-2 ft). On some sloping sites red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.12) and (Dr2.33) may
           occur. The higher flat-topped ridges mostly have loamy nodular yellow earths (Gn2.22) and occasionally
           red earths (Gn2.12). These are remnants of unit My3. More-dissected steeper ridges have shallow stony

            Ug5.29) with lesser brown clays (Ug5.34). The soils of the old levees are deep sands (Uc5.21) with some
            (Uc1.21) sandy levees adjacent to major stream channels
Si10 Level alluvial plains often with a slight (6-12 in.) gilgai microrelief: dominant are loamy duplex soils with
            mottled and bleached A horizons (6-12 in. deep) overlying dark grey-brown heavy clay (Dy2.33) and
            (Dy2.43). Some similar (Dy3) soils are associated. Where gilgai microrelief is prominent grey clays
            (Ug5.24) may occupy the puffs. In some more extensive clay plains cracking clays occupy puff and
            depression sites. Associated in the unit are small areas with very thin-surfaced (2-4 in.) loamy duplex
            soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) (unit Sl16) and also areas of deeper-surfaced sandy duplex soils (Dy3.43)
            (unit Va52). Where levees of prior streams occur in the unit small areas of loamy red duplex soils
            (Dr2.22) occur
Sl3 Undulating lands with some low stony hills and mesas: dominant soils are sandy or loamy-surfaced
            duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.32) with similar (Dy3) soils. Associated are deep sandy-
            surfaced duplex soils (Dy5.42), (Dy5.41), and similar (Dy4) soils; these mostly occur on upper slopes.
            Other duplex soils and red earths (Gn2.12) also occur but data are limited. The hilly areas have mostly
            stony (Um1.43) soils (unit Fz3). Adjacent to large streams deep sands (Uc1.23) may occur
Sl4 Small stream flood-plains that rise gradually to moderately undulating marginal valley slopes: dominant
            soils of the level areas are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), (Dy3.43), and (Dy3.33). Associated
            are smaller areas of similar (Dd1) and (Db1) soils and local occurrences of clays (Ug5.24), (Ug5.14),
            and (Ug5.16). Some stream levees have deep sand soils (Uc1.21). The marginal valley slopes have alkaline
          (Dy2), (Dd1), and (Db1) soils with some uniform clays (Uf6.33 and Uf6.31). Upslope these soils merge
          into the cracking clays of unit CB3
Sl5 Moderate to strongly undulating lands: dominant are sandy to loamy-surfaced duplex soils (Dy2.43),
           (Dy2.42), (Dy2.33), (Dy2.32), and (Dy2.12). Closely associated are similar (Dy3), (Db1), and occasional
           (Dr2) soils. On some upper slopes deeper-surfaced sandy duplex soils (Dy5.41) and (Dy3.42) occur.
           In small valley flood-plains (Dd1 .33) and (Dd1.43) soils occur. Small mesas of unit Bz4 are included
Sl6 Gently undulating lands with occasional low mesa-like residual hills: dominant are loamy duplex soils
           (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33), associated similar (Dd1) and (Dy3) soils, and less commonly (Db1) and (Dr2)
           soils. Included in the unit as mapped are areas of grey gilgaied clays (Ug5.24) of unit CC22, more
           particularly in lower sites. Small areas of non-gilgaied clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34) also occur. The mesa
           residuals have loamy red earths (Gn2. 11 and Gn2. 12) with some shallow stony (Um1 .43) soils associated
           with the scarps
Sl7 Very gently undulating or level alluvial plains: dominant are loamy duplex soils (A horizon 48 in.)
           with grey or grey-brown heavy clay subsoils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33). Associated are similar brown soils
           (Db1.13) and (Db1.33) and occasionally red or yellow duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Dr2.12), (Dy3.43), and
           (Dy3.33). Small areas of gilgaied clays (Ug5.24) may occupy lower landscape sites. As mapped, the
           unit may include low ridges of loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.11, Gn2.22, and Gn2.21)
Sl8 Low hilly lands on sedimentary rocks; moderate to gentle slopes, in places passing straight to the drainage-
           ways but elsewhere grading into concave lower slopes; some rock outcrop on higher hills: chief soils
           are hard alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy2.43) with (Dy3.43). Associated are: (Db1.42 and Db1.43)
           soils on higher slopes and crests; (Dr2.42), (Dr2.12), (Dr3.33), and (Dr3.42) soils on upper slopes;
           (Dd1.33) and (Dd1.43) soils on lower slopes and terraces; and gritty (Dy3.41) soils on some crests.
           Minor soil occurrences on terraces and a few saddles are (Ug5. 12), (Ug5. 13), (Ug5. 16), (Gn3 .43), (Ug5.4),
           and (Dy2.82)
Sl9 Gently to moderately undulating lands with some high ridges. The unit is a complex of loamy and often
           gravel-strewn loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33); slightly gilgaied deep cracking clays (Ug5.24) and
           (Ug5.16); thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dd1.13) and (Dd1.33); and less commonly similar (Db1)
           soils. On high ridges sandy duplex soils (Dy3.41 and Dy3.42) are most common but on some red earth
           remnants (Gn2.12) occur
Sl10 Level alluvial flood-plains that often have numerous braided stream channels; many areas are subject
           to flooding: dominant are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) but closely associated are (Dd1.33),
           (Dd1.43),(Dd1.13),and(Db1.33); some areas are wind-deflated. Small areas of cracking clays (Ug5.24),
           (Ug5.25), and (Ug5. 15) also occur together with other fine-textured soils (Uf6.32 and Uf6. 33). Occasional
           old sand-filled channels or sandy levees near major streams have deep sand soils (Uc1.23), (Uc1.21),
           and (Uc5.21)
Sl11 Strongly undulating or low hilly lands with some areas of flat-topped benched higher hills; the soils are
           mostly shallow and alternate over short distances depending on parent material lithology; rock outcrops
           are frequent; dominant are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) but closely associated are (Db1 .33),
           (Dr2.13), (Dr2.33), and (Dr2.12). Smaller areas of (Dd1.33), (Dd1.43), and (Ug5.22) occur on flatter
           sites. Associated drainage lines have small alluvial plains with deeper loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and
           (Dd1.43). The higher ridges and hills may have areas of shallow stony (Um1.41), (Um1.43), or (Um4.1)
           soils
Sl12 Low hilly lands consisting of undulating or level plateaux, often with steep-scarped margins, and lower
           dissected areas that are moderate to strongly undulating: a complex range of soils occurs--dominant
           are sandy to loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) but closely associated are (Dy2.33), (Dy2.13), (Dy2.23),
           (Dy2.42), and similar (Dy3) soils. Nearly all the duplex soils are shallow and stony. The plateau
           surfaces mostly have loamy red earths (Gn2.12) with lesser yellow earths (Gn2.22). Some higher hills
           have shallow stony loams (Um1.43) or (Um4.1), sands (Uc1.21) and (Uc2.12), or shallow stony red
           duplex soils (Dr2.21) and (Dr2.32). Lower flatter areas mostly have brown or red loamy duplex soils
           (Db1.13), (Dr2.13), and (Dr2.12). Data are fairly limited
Sl13 Small plains or gently sloping fans often dissected by many small stream channels: dominant are highly
           alkaline loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33).which in most areas are extremely eroded by wind
           and water so that only remnants of the bleached A2 horizon remain above the grey clay B horizon.
           Some wind-piled accumulations of A horizon sandy loam occur locally where trapped by shrubs.
           Associated are: other duplex soils (Db1.43), (Db1.33), and (Db1.23); occasional low sandy dunes
           (Uc1.23) or (Gn2.12); and small areas of grey clays (Ug5.24) in lower sites
Sl14 Alluvial plains dissected by numerous small irregular drainage channels; the entire area may be flooded:
           dominant are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) with similar (Db1) soils. Nearly all areas have
           been severely eroded by wind and water so that only remnants of the bleached A2 horizon remain
           above the grey to brown B horizon clay. Some wind-piled accumulations of sandy loam A horizon
           material occur around shrubby vegetation. Associated soils include slightly gilgaied grey clays (Ug5.24
           and Ug5.29); other clay soils (Uf6.51); and more extensive areas of earths (Gn2.55), (Gn2.83), and
           (Gn2.93) which also may have a scalded surface
Sl15 Level alluvial plains which may be dissected by shallow drainage lines: dominant are grey loamy duplex
          soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33), with lesser similar (Db1), (Dr2), and (Dy3) soils. Closely and often
          intimately associated are slightly lower areas of cracking clays (Ug5.29), (Ug5.24), (Ug5.28), and
          (Ug5.34). In some areas these may have a broad moderate gilgai microrelief (unit CC31). Also occurring
          are in-filled old stream channels or low rises with sandy or loamy yellow and red earths (Gn2.22),
          (Gn2.21), (Gn2.11), and (Gn2.12)
Sl16 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains: dominant are thin-surfaced (2 4 in.) loamy duplex soils
          (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33). Similar (Dy3) soils are closely associated but these normally have a deeper
          A horizon (6 10 in.). In some areas a very slight (4 6 in.) gilgai microrelief is present and the puffs
          may be grey clays (Ug5.28 and Ug5.29). Locally, slightly gilgaied clay plains (Ug5.28), less commonly
          (Ug5.16), may be more extensive. Also occurring in small areas are clays (Ug5.28) with a stronger
          gilgai microrelief (12-18 in.)
Sl17 Undulating or moderately undulating lands with occasional low hills: dominant are fairly shallow
          (18-24 in.) often stony loamy duplex soils. (Dy2.43) is most common but also occurring are (Dy2.42),
          (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), (Dr3.43), (Dr2.42), (Dr2.43), (Dd1.43), (Db1.43), and (Db1.33). On higher ridges
          and low hills very shallow stony loams (Um4.1), (Um1.43),and (Um2.12) occur. As mapped, the unit may
          include very small areas of dark clays (Ug5. 12)
Sl18 Strongly undulating or dissected low hilly lands: dominant are shallow mostly gravelly loamy duplex
          soils (Dy2.43 and Dy2.42) with other duplex soils (Dy3.43), (Dy3.42), (Dr2.43), and (Dr2.12) associated.
          On steeper slopes and hill crests shallow stony loams (Um4.1), (Um2.12), and (Um1.43) commonly occur
Sl19 Moderate or occasionally strongly undulating lands: dominant are extremely gravelly (quartz) loamy
          duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) with lesser (Dr2.43), (Dr2.33), (Db1.33), (Db1.13), and (Dy3.43)
          soils. On some higher ridges shallow gravelly loams occur (Um1.43) and (Um4.1), less common are
          gravelly sands (Uc2.12). Small areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12) occur in the unit as mapped, and
          there may be small areas of gravel-strewn moderately gilgaied grey clays (Ug5.24) in lower sites
Sl20 Undulating to strongly undulating lands with some low hilly areas. The soils usually have a strongly
          linear distribution controlled by the strike of the parent sedimentary rocks. Rock outcrops are common.
          A complex array of soils is present but nearly all are shallow and stony. Dominant are highly alkaline
          loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) with closely associated (Dy3.43). Red loamy duplex soils
          (Dr2.43), (Dr2.33), and (Dr2.12) are common in many areas but other duplex soils (Dd1.43), (Dd1.33),
          and (Db1.33) are less common. On some flatter sites grey clays (Ug5.22) may occur and small alluvial
          flood-plains have deep loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Db1.33), and (Dd1.43). Low hills and high ridge
          crests usually have shallow stony loams (Um1.41), (Um2.12). and (Um4.1). In some areas low plateau
          remnants of loamy yellow or red earths (Gn2.22) and (Gn2.12) occur
Sl21 Gently undulating plains: dominant are loamy duplex soils with a slightly gravel-strewn surface. The
            chief forms are (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) but (Db1.33), (Db1.13), (Db1.43), and similar (Dy3) soils are
            often closely associated. Also occurring are smaller areas of slightly gilgaied (1-2 ft) or non-gilgaied
            grey clays (Ug5.24), or less commonly brown clays (Ug5.34). In addition there are occasional low rises
            of loamy or sandy red earths (Gn2.12) and yellow earths (Gn2.22). In some localities there may be
            occasional high stony ridges with shallow stony soils (Uc1.21), (Uc2.12), (Um1.41), and (Um4.1)
Sl22 Undulating lands with widely spaced shallow valleys and some small sloping plains; rock outcrop
            may occur on higher ridges: dominant are thin-surfaced (2-4 in.) grey loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43)
            of moderate to shallow depth but many other duplex soils are always associated. These include (Dy2.33),
            (Dy2.13), (Dr2.33), (Dr2.43), (Dr2.13), (Dr2.12), (Dd1.43), (Dd1.33), (Dd1.13), and similar (Db1)
            soils. The surface of most duplex soils is variably strewn with small gravel fragments. Cracking clays
            chiefly (Ug5.22) and (Ug5.14) are important on lower slopes and on the small plains. Some high stony
            ridges in the unit have shallow stony loams (Um4.1), (Um1.43), and (Um2.12)
Sl23 Moderate to strongly undulating lands with an occasional low hill; the area is usually strongly dissected
            by many small streams and nearly all soils have a gravel-strewn surface and are often eroded; rock
            outcrops are common. A complex array of loamy duplex soils is present, most are shallow (18-20 in.).
            The dominant soil is (Dy2.43) but commonly associated are (Dy2.33), (Dy3.43), (Dr2.33), (Dr2.43),
            (Dr2.31), (Dr2.12), (Dr2.13), (Db1.33), and (Dd1.33). Limited areas of cracking clays (Ug5.22),
            (Ug5.32), and (Ug5.15) also occur. The occasional hills have extremely stony shallow (Dy2.43),
            (Um4.1), and (Um2.12) soils
Sl24 Gently undulating plains with a complex pattern of soils: dominant are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) with
            closely associated (Dy3.43). Very low rises occurring throughout the unit have loamy red earths (Gn2.12)
            with lesser areas of yellow earths (Gn2.22) or grey earths (Gn2.85) and (Gn2.95). Small areas of
            moderately gilgaied grey clays (Ug5.24 and Ug5.28) also occur throughout, closely associated with
            thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33). Adjacent to some larger streams are small
            areas of (Db1.33), (Gn2.12), and (Um5.5) soils forming narrow alluvial plains often dissected by
            distributary channels
Sl25 Very gently undulating birds-foot fans: chief soils are hard alkaline yellow and yellow mottled soils
            (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.43) on broad low banks in "toe" and "medial" positions of the fans. Associated
            are (Gn3.05) soils in broad elongate flats and (Gn3.03) with (Ug5.24) soils in complex on the melon-hole
            depressional flats. Minor soil occurrences include (Dd1.41), (Dr2.22), and (Gn2.44)
Sl26 Low to moderately high hills with gentle to moderate valley side slopes; some rock outcrop: chief
            soils are hard alkaline yellow soils (Dy2.43) on valley side slopes and valley plains. Associated are
            various (Uc), (Um), and (Dy) soils on crests and upper slopes. Occurrences of small areas of other
            soils are likely
Sl27 Low to moderately hilly lands with steep upper slopes and gentle lower slopes passing to narrow valleys;
            some rock outcrop on upper slopes: chief soils are hard alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy2.43) on lower
            slopes and on valley floors. Associated are shallow (Uc) soils on the steep upper slopes, some (Dd1.23)
            soils on slopes, and some deep (Uc) and (Dy3.43) soils on alluvial flats. Minor soil occurrences include
            gilgai complexes of (Dy2.33) and (Ug5.2) soils. As mapped, small areas of unit Mo20 are included

            including some higher country with steep slopes: chief soils are hard acidic and neutral yellow mottled
            soils (Dy3.31 and Dy3.32). Associated are (Uc2.12) soils on hill crests and (Dy2.21 and Dy2.22) soils
            on hill slopes. Other soils encountered are: (Uc4.1) on hill crests; (Dy3.81) on upper slopes; (Dr3.21)
            on slopes; (Dy3.41). (Dy3.42), and (Ug5.16) on creek flats; and (Gn3.92) on some stream levees
Ti2 Generally low hilly terrain on tonalite with significant alluvial flats--an erosion valley largely confined
            by its erosion scarp: chief soils are hard acidic yellow mottled soils (Dy3.31) on crests and slopes.
            Associated are (Dy2.11) soils on crests and slopes. Other soils include: (Dr2.11); (Gn3.14) soils on
            mica schists; (Gn3.91) on volcanic rocks; and (Gn2.91 and Gn2.94) on alluvial flats
Ti3 Rolling terrain of sandy and clayey alluvia over dissected sandstone--broad gently sloping flats and low
            convex rises with gentle slopes: chief soils are hard acidic yellow mottled soils (Dy3.3 1) and (Dy3.41 ) on
            slopes and better-drained flats. Associated are (Gn2.24), (Gn2.64), and (Gn2.74) soils on ridge crests
            and sand stringers with (Dg2.31) and (Dg4.81) soils on fairly wet flats. Minor soils include (Uc2.34)
            on sand stringers, (Dy5.81) and (Dy5.61) on flats, and small areas of a variety of other soils
Ti4 High hilly or hilly lands with some mountainous areas, steep slopes occur throughout; rock outcrop
            is usually common: dominant are sandy or loamy duplex soils (Dy3.31) and (Dy3.21) of shallow to
            moderate depth (2430 in.). The A horizons are normally stony but the clay B horizons are often stone-
            free. Associated are similar (Dy2) soils, some areas of red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.11), (Dr2.21), and
            (Dr2.41), and brown friable earths (Gn3.24 and Gn3.21). Throughout the unit are areas of shallow
            stony loams (Um1.43) and (Um2.12)
Ti5 Strongly undulating or low hilly lands usually with much rock outcrop. A range of shallow stony sandy
            duplex soils occur, chiefly (Dy3.31) but with (Dy3.21), (Dy2.31), (Dy2.12), and (Dr2.12) all occurring
            locally. On higher more stony areas shallow gritty sands (Uc4.2) and (Uc5.11) are common. Data
            are fairly limited

            moderately steep slopes are hard acidic yellow mottled soils (Dy3.41), (Dy3.21), and (Dy3.61). Associated
            on the slopes are various soils such as (Dr3.41), (Uc4.1), (Um4.2), and (Gn2.1), with rock outcrops;
            and small terraced alluvial valleys of a wide variety of soils such as (Dy5.61), (Dy5.81), (Dy5.11),

            (Uc2) soils. As mapped, small areas of adjoining units are included
Tb65 Gently rolling areas of the subcoastal lowlands (less than 400 ft above sea level) with a maximum relief
            of 50 ft between crests and valleys. The soil pattern is complex and controlled by the lithology of the
            parent rock material. Chief soils seem to be hard acidic and neutral yellow and red soils (Dy3.41),
            (Dy3.42), (Dr3.41), and (Dr2.12) on sandstones. Associated are: cracking clays (Ug5.12), (Ug5.23),

            lateritic knolls and hills; narrow drainage-ways: chief soils on the hills and broad convex slopes are
            hard acidic yellow and yellow mottled soils (Dy3.41) and (Dy3.31) with (Dy2.41) and (Dy2.31).

Ub83 Moderately undulating lands with occasional low stony hills: dominant are sandy to loamy duplex
            soils of shallow to moderate depths (18-40 in.). The chief forms are (Dy3.42) and (Dy3.32) but (Dy3.41)
            and (Dy3.43) occasionally occur. Associated are areas of deep sandy duplex soils (Dy5.42) and (Dy5.32)
            and loamy-surfaced (Dy2.42) and (Dy2.32) soils. The occasional high stony ridges and low hills have
            shallow sands (Uc1.21) and (Uc4.2) or loams (Um1.43)
Ub84 Strongly undulating lands with some low hilly areas; rock outcrop may be common: dominant are
            loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42) of moderate to shallow depth and usually stony. Closely associated are
            (Dy3.43), (Dy3.41), and (Dy2.42) together with locally important areas of red duplex soils (Dr2.12).
            Higher hills have shallow stony loams (Um1.43), (Um1.42), and (Um2.12). Adjacent to some drainage
            lines are loamy friable earths (Gn3.25) and occasional swampy areas of dark clays (Ug5.16)
Ub85 Hilly lands with steep slopes but rounded hill crests and some strongly undulating areas merging into
            narrow valley floors: rock outcrop is common: dominant are fairly shallow (18-24 in.) sandy to loamy
            duplex soils with stony A horizons but mostly stone-free clay B horizons. The chief form is (Dy3.42)
            but (Dy3.41) and (Dy3.21) also commonly occur. Associated are similar (Dy2) soils and some areas of
            (Dr2.12 and Dr2.11). Steeper hills have shallow stony loams (Um1.43) and (Um2.12) or sands (Uc2.21).
            On small alluvial stream flood-plains loamy (Dy3.43) soils are common
Ub86 Undulating lands with some isolated low hilly areas: dominant are loamy or occasionally sandy duplex
            soils of moderate to shallow depth; on higher landscape sites the soils are usually stony. The chief
            form is (Dy3.42) with (Dy3.41) and less often (Dy3.43), (Dy3.33), and (Dy3.32). Similar (Dy2) soils
            are associated and on the low hills are shallow stony loams (Um1.42) and (Um2.12)
Ub87 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains rising slowly to undulating low foothills: dominant
           are fine sandy or loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy3.42) but (Dy3.43), (Dy3.41), (Dy3.32), (Dy3.33),
           and similar (Dy2) soils also occur. In lower swampy areas a prominent (6-8 in.) trench gilgai micro-
           relief is often present. Also present in the unit are slightly higher old stream levees with coarse-textured
           gradational soils (Gn2.44) and (Gn3.24) and occasionally brown sandy duplex soils (Db1.22). On the
           undulating foothills shallower stony duplex soils (Dy3.41 and Dy3.42) are common, (Gn3.24) occurring
           less often. Adjacent to the coast the unit grades into salt pans with (Uf6.6) and eroded (Dy3.43) soils,
           and mangrove swamps. The unit is very similar to Va47 but neutral soils are dominant
Ub88 Alluvial plains often terraced rising to strongly undulating foothills: dominant soils of the broader
           plains are loamy-surfaced (Dy3.42) and (Dy3.32) but (Dy3.21), (Db1.21), (Db1.22), (Dy3.33), and
           (Dy3.43) also occur. Higher terraces have brown friable earths (Gn3.24) and the most recent terraces
           have uniform loams (Um6.31) and (Um5.4). The moderate to strongly undulating foothills have sandy
           duplex soils (Dy3.41), (Dy3.42), and (Db1.21)
Ub89 Moderate to strongly undulating lands with occasional low hilly areas: dominant are shallow loamy
           duplex soils (Dy3.42) and (Dy3.32) but with (Dy3.43), (Dy3.33), and similar (Dy2) soils also common.
           A prominent gravelly stone line is often present at the base of the A horizons. Higher ridges and low
           hilly areas have very shallow stony similar duplex soils and also some occurrences of (Dr2.12), (Db1.12),
           (Db1.22), (Um1.43), and (Um2.12)
Vc3 Gently undulating sandy plains underlain by mottled highly alkaline saline clays; near the margin of
           Lake Buchanan the landscape consists of low broad parallel dunes. The chief soils are (Dy3.23) and
           (Dy3.43) with lesser (Dy3.63), (Dy5.63), and (Dy5.43). The partly included dry margins of Lake Buchanan
           have saline clays (Uf6.61) with some salt incrustations occurring locally. In some areas of this unit
           it is likely that the duplex profiles are due to wind-blown sand covering clay pans
Vd2 Level or very gently undulating plains and broad shallow valleys associated with drainage lines: dominant
           soils have deep sandy A horizons and are chiefly (Dy3.33) and (Dy3.43), but (Dy3.23), (Dy3.32), and
           similar (Dy5) soils also occur. Smaller areas of loamy-surfaced (Dy2.33) soils are associated with
           some drainage lines. Included in the unit as mapped are small areas of sandy yellow earths (Gn2.22),
           (Gn2.62), and occasionally swampy depressions with clay soils (Ug5.24)
Vd3 Gently undulating slightly elevated plains with a slight (6-12 in.) gilgai microrelief: dominant soils
          have loamy A horizons 412 in. deep. The chief form is (Dy3.33), rarely (Dy3.43). These duplex soils
          occur on level sites, most puffs, and all depressions; in the latter, A horizons are at the deep end of
          the range. Occasionally on some better-defined puffs grey clays (Ug5.24) occur. Data are fairly limited
Vd4 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains: dominant are duplex soils with fine sandy or loamy A
          horizons 6-10 in. deep. The chief forms are (Dy3.33) and (Dy3.43). Closely associated are slightly
          lower plains with a gilgai complex. The clay puffs are elevated (4 6 in.) and have grey or dark grey
          clays (Ug5.28) and (Ug5.16). Intervening areas have loamy duplex soils (Dy3.33), (Dy3.43), (Dy2.43),
          (Dy2.33), and (Dd1.33); A horizon depth ranges from 4 to 6 in. Also included in the association are
          smaller slightly gilgaied clay plains with clay-dominant soils (Ug5.16) and (Ug5.28), and some areas
          of thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (unit Sl16)
Vd5 Moderate to strongly undulating lands with occasional high strike ridges with sandstone outcrop:
          dominant are loamy duplex soils with mottled yellow-brown subsoils. The chief form is (Dy3.33) but
          (Dy3.23) and (Dy3.43) also occur. Important areas of red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.12), (Dr2.32),
          (Dr2.42), and (Dr3.33) are present in the unit. Associated small alluvial plains have grey loamy duplex
          soils (Dy2.43) and occasional highly calcareous ridges have shallow loams (Um1.3). Where sandstone
         outcrop is prominent shallow sand soils of units JJ13 and Cd15 are found
Va24  Gently undulating plains of hard alkaline and neutral yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43 and Dy3.42) and
      (Dy2.43 and Dy2.42); some acid variants may occur. Associated are: (i) (Db1.43) soils; (ii) sandy
      soils (Dy5.41 and Dy5.42) and (Dy5.81 and Dy5.82) near drainage lines; and (iii) small areas of (Dr2)
      and (Dr3) soils. Some high stony ridges, scarps, or mesa-like remnants of units Fz2 and Fz3 may occur,
      as may inclusions of unit CC20
Va25  Plains: chief soils are hard alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.33) with (Dd1.33) and
      (Dd1.43) soils--often in complex with cracking grey clays (Ug5.2). Minor areas of soils of unit My3
      are included
Va28  Undulating ridges and some gently sloping plains: dominant soils have a deep sandy surface overlying
      mottled clay (Dy3.43), (Dy3.33), (Dy3.42), and (Dy3.82). Associated are areas with a loose sandy surface
      (Dy5.41 and Dy5.42) and (Dy5.81 and Dy5.82). Smaller areas of sandy red earths (Gn2.12 and Gn2.11)
      also occur together with areas of loamy yellow-grey duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy2.43), and red duplex
      soils (Dr2.21 and Dr2.22), (Dr2.31 and Dr2.32), and (Dr2.41 and Dr2.42)
Va29  Undulating or rarely strongly undulating lands with an occasional isolated low hill: dominant soils
      have fine loamy A horizons (8-12 in.) overlying mottled clay. Chief forms are (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.33)
      with smaller areas of neutral types. Associated are small areas of other mottled duplex soils (Dr3.32),
      (Db2.43), and (Dy5.42). In valley floors loamy (Dy2.43) soils are common and the isolated stony hills
      have gravelly (Um1.43) and (Uc1.23) soils
Va30 Undulating or moderately undulating lands with occasional low hilly areas: a complex range of soils
            is present but on moderate slopes loamy-surfaced duplex soils are dominant, chiefly (Dy3.43 and Dy3.42),
            with smaller areas of (Dr2.12), (Dr2.43), and (Dy2.43). Small areas of deeper-surfaced (Dy5.42 and
            Dy5.43) soils also occur. On more gentle slopes there may be areas of cracking clays (Ug5.22) and
            (Ug5.32) with associated duplex soils (Dd1.33) and (Db1.33) and small areas of friable earths (Gn3.93)
            and (Gn3.23). Aggraded valley floors have loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dd1.43). The occasional
            low hills have shallow stony sands (Uc1.21 and Uc1.23) or loams (Um1.43)
Va31 Gentle or moderately undulating lands with some more strongly dissected marginal slopes: dominant
            soils are loamy-surfaced (6-8 in.) (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.33). Also occurring, more particularly on the
            marginal slopes, are duplex soils with deeper sandy A horizons (1-20 in.) which are often gravelly.
            Common forms are (Dy3.43 and Dy3 .42). Other duplex soils also occur, particularly along drainage lines;
            these are chiefly (Db1.13), (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), (Dd1.13), (Dd1.33), and (Dy4.32). Included in the unit
            are small areas of moderately to strongly gilgaied cracking clays (Ug5.24) and occasional small areas
            of sandy red earths (Gn2. 11)

            mottled soils (Dy3.43). Associated are hard neutral gley soils (Dg2.82) on crests of low rises; hard
            alkaline dark soils (Dd1.43) on concave slopes; and hard acidic yellow and red mottled soils (Dy3.41)
            and (Dr3.41) on cuesta crests. Small areas of other soils may occur
Va33 Similar to unit Va32 but there are a large number of mesas with shallow (Um) soils. There are some
            areas of leached sands (Uc2.22) as well
Va34 Moderately hilly lands largely on mudstones and sandstones--generally short medium slopes straight
            to drainage-ways but some low hilly areas with gentle slopes: chief soils are hard alkaline yellow

Va37 Valley plains, colluvial formations, and areas of low hills with rounded crests; derived from acidic
           rocks and freshwater sediments: chief soils are hard alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43) in alluvial,
           colluvial, and sedentary sites. Associated are: (Dd1.43) and (Dd1.23) soils in colluvial and alluvial
           sites; (Dy2.41), (Dy3.41), and (Dy3.42) soils on the hills; (Um2.12) and (Um4.1) on hill crests;

Va41 Narrow valley plains with minor terrace levels, marginal slopes, and spurs cut in strongly weathered
           and lateritized sedimentary rocks: dominant soils are the hard alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43)
           and (Dy2.43) of the valley plains and lower slopes. Associated are (Dy3.41 and Dy3.42) soils of marginal
           slopes; (Db1.13) and (Dd1.43) on terraces; and shallow (Gn2.11), (Dr2.21), and (Dr2.41) often contain-
           ing ironstone gravels on the lower slopes and spurs
Va42 Generally low hilly country on sandstones and shales with gentle to moderate slopes and some narrower
           ridges and spurs: chief soils are hard alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43) with some (Dy2.43) over all
           mid and lower slopes. Associated are (Dy2.42) and (Dy3.42) soils on upper slopes and broader crests
           and (Uc2.12) soils on crests and steep sites. Other soil occurrences include (Dr2.41), (Dr2.42), (Dy3.41),
           and (Db1 .42). There are small inclusions of unit FM1
Va43 Generally low hilly country with distinct valley plains: dominant soils of the low hilly areas are hard
           alkaline yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43). These areas are similar to unit Va42. Dominant soils of the
           valley plains are alkaline dark friable earths (Gn3.43). These areas are similar to unit Mm14
Va44 Undulating to gently rolling lands on tertiary sandstones and gravels: chief soils are hard alkaline
           yellow mottled soils (Dy3.43). Associated are (Dy2.43) soils; (Gn3.43) and (Ug5.14) soils under
           brigalow; and some (Gn3.1) soils. Data are limited
Va45 Strongly undulating slopes rising to rounded low hilly areas; rock outcrop is common on higher land-
           scape sites: dominant are shallow stony loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.33). Associated are
           shallow stony loams (Um1.43), (Um1.42), (Um1.41), and (Um2.12), and small areas of shallow stony
           red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.22), (Dr2.12), and (Dr2.43). Similar (Dy2) soils may also occur
Va46 Level or gently undulating alluvial flood-plains of limited extent, rising to undulating low foothills:
           dominant are loamy-surfaced duplex soils (Dy3.43) with lesser (Dy3.42) and similar (Dy2) soils. On
           slightly higher old stream levees sandy-surfaced soils (Gn3.25), (Dr2.22), (Db1.12), and (Db1.22) occur.
           In small local swampy depressions are cracking clays (Ug5.16) and (Ug5.24)
Va47 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains rising slowly to undulating low foothills: dominant
           soils have fine sandy or loamy A horizons overlying strongly mottled clay (Dy3.43). Closely associated
           are (Dy3.42 and Dy3.41) and (Dy3.33 and Dy3.32). Similar (Dy2) soils may also occur. The surface
           of lower swampy areas has a prominent (6-8 in.) irregular trench gilgai microrelief. Slightly higher old
           stream levees traversing the plains have coarser-textured gradational soils (Gn3.24), (Gn2.44), and
           (Gn2.71) or occasional brown duplex soils (Db1.22). On the undulating marginal foothills shallow
           often stony loamy duplex soils occur, chiefly (Dy3.42 and Dy3.41). Where the unit is adjacent to the
           coast the (Dy3) soils merge into salt pans (eroded (Dy3.43) soils), mangrove swamps, or less commonly
           marine plains (unit NN2). This unit is very similar to unit Ub87
Va48 Level alluvial plains with some terraces developed near major streams: dominant are moderately
           deep-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.33) but (Dy3.42), (Dy3.32), and similar (Dy2)
           soils also often occur. In lower swampy sites there are dark cracking clays (Ug5.16). The more recent
           terraces have a variety of gradational sandy or loamy soils, including (Gn3.93 and Gn3.91), (Gn3.54
           and Gn3.51), and (Db1.21 and Db1.22). Near the coast the unit may merge into mangrove swamps
           and salt pans

           lines; granite tor outcrop may be common: dominant are fairly coarse sandy duplex soils with strongly
           mottled sandy clay subsoils at moderate depths (10-15 in.). Most common form is (Dy3.43) but (Dy3.42)
           and (Dy3.41) also occur. Associated are some areas of similar (Dy2) and (Dy5) soils and also occurrences
           of gritty gradational soils (Gn2.12) and (Gn2.45). On higher ridges and low hills gritty stony sands are
           common, chiefly (Uc5.11), (Uc2.12), (Uc4.11), (Uc4.2), and (Uc1.22). Also occurring in the unit as
           mapped are small areas of red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.12) and occasionally similar gradational soils
           (Gn3.12)
Va50 Undulating or gently undulating lands: dominant are sandy or loamy often gritty duplex soils (Dy3.43)
            with lesser (Dy3.33) and (Dy3.42). Some similar (Dy2) soils also occur. Closely associated, particularly
            on higher landscape sites, are loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.12), rarely (Dr2.13). Small areas of granite
            outcrop within the unit have shallow coarse sands (Uc4.2 and Uc4.1), less commonly (Uc2.12)
Va51 Gently or broadly undulating plains: dominant are sandy to loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy3.43) but
            (Dy3.42), (Dy3.32), (Dy5.42), and similar (Dy2) soils also occur. On some higher ridge crests sandy
            or loamy red earths occur (Gn2.12) and there may also be some small level plains of loamy or sandy
            yellow earths (Gn2.22 and Gn2.21). In some lower sites gilgaied grey clays (units CC30 and CC33) may
            occur associated with (Dy2.33) and (Dy2.43) soils. Fringing major streams are narrow levees with sandy
            or loamy duplex soils (Dr2.22), (Dy3.33), and (Dr3.32)
Va52 Undulating or gently undulating lands with occasional small low sandstone cuestas or mesas near the
            margins of the unit: dominant are mostly sandy duplex soils with deep A horizons (10-20 in.); the
            lower A2 and upper B horizons often have many ironstone nodules. The chief form is (Dy3.43) but
            (Dy3.42), (Dy5.31), (Dy5.41), (Dy5.21), and similar (Dy2) soils also occur, together with small areas
            of earthy sands (Uc5.22). These latter and the (Dy5) soils occur most commonly near marginal sandstone
            ranges. Where present the low sandstone mesas and cuestas have sandy soils (Uc4.1), (Uc2.12), and
            (Uc1.21). In some lower landscape sites small areas of grey clays occur (unit CC30), or loamy duplex
            soils (Dy2.43)
Va53 Undulating lands with occasional high ridges or low hills: dominant are mostly shallow (18-24 in.)
            often stony fine loamy-surfaced duplex soils (6 8 in. A horizons) with highly alkaline mottled clay
            subsoils (Dy3.43). Similar (Dy2) soils are also present with (Dr2.43) and (Dr3.43) occurring on higher
            slopes. Some ridges and the low hills have rock outcrop and shallow stony loams (Um4.1), (Um1.43),
            and (Um2.12). In lower sites there may be areas of gilgaied clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34) associated
            with loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), and similar (Db1) soils
Va54 Strongly undulating or low hilly lands occupying a broad dissected valley within the high sandstone
            ranges of unit JJ12: dominant are loamy- or sandy-surfaced duplex soils with mottled yellow clay
            subsoils (Dy3.43). Other soils occurring include (Db1.43), (Db2.43), (Dy2.43), (Dy5.41), and (Dr2.43).
            Some eroded siliceous sandstone hills with shallow (Uc) soils occur in the unit, particularly marginally;

       soils as well as some (Gn2.12) soils
Oc63  Pediplains on granite; more dissected than unit Oc62 and usually occurring as a zone flanking the main
       stream courses: chief soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) and (Dr2.43). There are more areas of
       (Um5.11) soils on calcrete (kunkar) than in unit Oc62 and some (Uc5.11) and (Uc1.22) soils occur along
       creeks
Oc64  Low stony hills and dissected pediments on granite with occasional basic dykes: chief soils are hard,
       alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) having shallow stony A horizons. Associated are shallow stony (Uc5.11)

       (kunkar)
Oc65  Low stony hills and steeply dissected pediments in areas of fine-grained sandstone, shale, and dolomite.
       There may be small areas of ferruginous duricrust and Robe pisolite as a capping. The soils are often
       shallow and stony: chief soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) with some (Uc5.11) soils. (Um5.11)
       soils may occur on calcrete (kunkar) in the narrow valley plains and on exposures of calcareous rocks.
       (KS-Gn2. 11) soils occur on the small area of ferruginous duricrust and Robe pisolite
Oc66  Gently undulating pediplains extending out from breakaways capped by Robe pisolite deposits and other
       related formations. There may be a few small flat-topped residuals rising above the pediplains: chief soils
       are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33). Small areas of (Um5.11) soils may be associated with occasional
       patches of calcrete (kunkar). Minor soil occurrences include (Uf6.71), (Ug5.37), (Gn2.13), and stony
       (Gn2. 12) soils
Oc67  Plains: dominant soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33). Associated are extensive areas of (Um5.52)
       soils with (Ug5.38) soils in central landscape positions. Small areas of (Gn2.12) soils also occur as well
       as (Um5.11) on calcrete (kunkar)
Oc68  Dissected stony pediments with some steep stony hills: chief soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33)
       but quite large areas of hard neutral red soils (Dr2.32) occur too. There are also significant areas of
       (Um5.5) soils
Oc69           Valley plains with occasional low flat-topped residuals that are often capped by iron ore formations
               but sometimes by calcrete (kunkar): hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) are dominant with some areas of
                (Dr2.32) soils. Significant areas of (Uf6.71) and (Um5.52) soils also occur. Minor soil occurrences
               include (Ug5.38) soils in central landscape positions; (Uc1.22) along creek channels; (KS-Gn2.11) on
                                                      the iron ore formation; and (Um5.11) on the calcrete (kunkar)
Oc70      Dissected pediments and low stony hills associated with cherts, jaspilites, and iron ore formations; much
               coarse surface gravel: chief soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2 33) along with some (Dr2.32) and
                                                                                                     (Um5.52) soils
Oc71           Outwash plains with much coarse surface gravel: chief soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) but
                   (Uf6.71), (Ug5.38), and (Gn2.12) soils also occur. There are areas of (Gc) soils in proximity to
                                                                                                          unit Lb12
Oc72       Plains dominated by hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) with some areas of (Gn2.12), (Uf6.71), and (Ug5.38)
                                                                                                              soils
Oc73        Partially dissected pediments with some low stony hills. This unit usually flanks areas of unit Fa1O or
      unit Fa11: chief soils are hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.33) along with some areas of (Dr2.32) soils. Shallow
          stony (Uc5.11) soils occur on the steeper slopes. (Um5.3), (Gn2.11), and (Uc5.21) soils, with a red-brown
                                     hardpan beneath, occur on the lower slopes and on small areas of valley plains
Oc74          Dissected pediments with low stony hills as in unit Oc70, and with some residuals capped by ironstone
                      gravels and underlain by pallid zones to 30 ft; pediments have a gravel veneer of coarse rock
                 fragments: hard alkaline and neutral red soils (Dr2.33 and Dr2.32) are dominant with some (Um5.52)
                     on pediments and rock outcrop, and there are gravelly loams (KS-Um5.51) and sands (KS-Uc5.21)
                                                             overlying duricrust at shallow depths on the residuals
Og1                Low very gently undulating pediplain and plains on Permian sediments, with occasional low dunes;
               surface quartz gravels are widespread: hard alkaline red soils (Dr2.73) are dominant along with some
      (Dr2.13), (Dr2.23), and (Dr2.33) soils. (Uc1.23) soils occur on the low dunes
A20 Low dunes and old beach ridges marginal and mostly parallel to the coastline; the dUnes rarely exceed 10 ft in
          height and may be separated by shallow swales; beach rock may outcrop on the coastal margins. All except
          the rear dunes are shelly throughout or at shallow depth. Dominant soils are calcareous sands (Uc1.11) with
          some dark and brown sands (Uc1.13, Uc1.14) also occurring. At the rear of the dune systems siliceous
          forms (Uc1.21) and (Uc5.11) usually occur and occasionally (Uc5.23) and (Uc4.21). The better-developed
          swales have dark loams (Um1.13), occasionally (Uf1.3) and (Uf6.33). Included in the unit, as mapped, are
          small areas of salt pans of unit Io1, and cracking clays of unit II12
B35 Low dunes and old beach ridges parallel to the coastline, now fixed by vegetation: dominant soils on the
          inland, more extensive, systems are deep loose siliceous sands, chiefly (Uc1.21), but with (Uc1.23, Uc1.22)
          occurring in some localities. In the smaller shallow swales deep sands (Uc1.21) and (Uc5.11) are also common,
          but in wider swales clays occur, chiefly (Uf6.41) but occasionally (Ug5.16). A narrow zone of more recent
          shelly dunes normally occurs where the unit is adjacent to the coast; these have deep (Uc1.11 or Uc1.13 and
          Uc1.14) soils. In some areas broad slightly elevated old beach ridges have (Uc4.21) soils. Small salt pans
          with (Uf6.41), (Uf6.51), and (Uf6.61) saline clays are often included in the unit
B36 Extensive areas of siliceous sand dunes aligned in a NE-SE. direction, normally transverse to the coastline.
          The dunes are often of elongated parabolic form, with numerous ridges up to 50 or 100 ft high fixed by
          vegetation. In general the height of the dunes tends to decrease towards the northern extremities of the unit.
          The noses and less commonly the trailing arms of the parabolic dunes often have active advancing areas of
          spilling sand; other less regular areas of active blow-outs also occur. Shallow freshwater lakes are common,
          particularly in swales or within the areas of the parabolic dunes. The soils of the dunes are deep loose
          white sands (Uc1.21), with a slightly darkened organic A horizon where the dunes are fixed by vegetation;
          many dunes have a core of organic-cemented sand and this is usually exposed on lake floors. Associated
          with the dune systems, particularly in the occurrences around and to the north of Shelburne Bay, are fairly
          extensive vegetated sand plains with only occasional low dunes; on these, deep bleached sands (Uc2.21,
          Uc2.23) are common. In the far north, some of the older inland vegetated dunes have (Uc4.21) soils. In
          some areas, particularly in the south, where narrow swales are well developed between high dune ridges,
          sandy-surfaced gleyed duplex soils (Dg4.41) occur
B37 Undulating irregular old vegetated dunes and sand-covered ridges: dominant soils are probably deep to
          moderately deep sands (Uc1.21), with some deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) in lower flatter sites. In parts of
          the unit small areas of the basement rocks of unit Fu25 may be exposed. Data are extremely limited
B38 Moderately to strongly undulating densely vegetated old high dunes which are inland from, and approximately
          parallel to, the coastline: dominant soils are deep loose sands (Uc1.21) with moderately organic A1 horizons;
          these soils occur both on the irregular dune ridges and in the interdune swales. In the northern occurrences
          of the unit relief is less, and there probably are areas of deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) associated. Data are
          limited
Bz7 Hilly or low hilly lands, often very strongly dissected with deep narrow ravines and steep-sided cliffs, massive
          sandstone outcrop is very common: dominant soils are shallow gravelly sands (Uc1.21), with other sand
          soils (Uc4.11) and (Uc2.12) associated. Also occurring are shallow stony loams (Um1.41, Um1.43),
          (Um2.12), and (Um4.1). Particularly near the margins, there may be small areas of sandy or loamy, red
          or yellow earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12) and (Gn2.21)
Bz16 Rugged hilly lands with steep slopes, some scarps and long rocky slopes; much bare rock (conglomeratic
          sandstone) outcrop: dominant soils are shallow very gravelly sands (Uc1.21), (K-Uc1.21), with associated
          (Uc4.21, Uc4.22) and (Uc5.21, Uc5.22). On outwash slopes are sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21, Gn2.22) and
          some red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12). Data are limited
Bz17 Strongly undulating or occasionally low hilly lands with much rock outcrop (sandstone and lateritized
          sandstone): all soils are shallow and very gravelly. Sands (Uc1.21), (Uc2.12), and (Uc5.23) are probably
          most common, but on the dissected laterite areas shallow loams (Um1.41) and (Um2.12) and shallow
          earths (Gn2.24) and (Gn2.44) are usually dominant. On flatter sites sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21) and
          bleached grey earths (Gn2.94) commonly occur. Data are very limited
Bz18 Low hilly to hilly lands with extremely rocky steep scree slopes: dominant soils are very shallow gravelly
          sands (Uc1.23, Uc1.21) and (K-Uc1.23, K-Uc1.21), with associated (Uc4.12), (Uc4.22), and (Uc1.43). In
          the valleys are sandy red or yellow earths (Gn2.1) and (Gn2.2), and occasionally some gravelly-surfaced
          red or yellow duplex soils (Dr2.12), (Dr2.4), and (Dy2.4)
Bz19 High sandstone plateaux with prominent cliffs and steep rocky slopes, much dissected at the margins. Rock
          outcrop is very common and all soils have much gravel throughout the profile: dominant soils are very
          shallow gravelly sands (Uc1.23) with associated soils similar to those of unit Bz18
BY5 Broad plateaux and mesas on siltstones, sandstones, and conglomerates, dissected by many streamlines;
          some breakaway slopes; rock outcrops: chief soils are shallow gravelly and stony sands (K-Uc1 .4), (K-Uc4. 1 ),
          (KS-Uc1.4), and (KS-Uc4.1). Associated are small areas of yellow and red earths (Gn2.61, Gn2.64),
          (Gn2.74), and (Gn2.12), often containing some ironstone gravels, on mid and lower valley slopes. Some
          lateritic remnants occur locally. Some areas of adjoining units are included in areas of greater dissection,
          also some ridges of unit Bz16
Cd17 Strongly undulating or low hilly lands, mostly with short slopes; granite tor outcrop is occasionally prominent:
         dominant soils of the higher or steeper landscape sites are shallow gritty bleached sands (Uc2.12), together
         with other shallow sands (Uc4.11); rock outcrop is common. On lower slopes and valley floors, sandy or
         loamy duplex soils are common, chiefly (Dy3.42), (Dy2.42, Dy2.43), (Dy3.21), and (Dr3.22). Gritty grey
         earths (Gn2.82) and (Gn2.95) may also occur. Throughout the unit the dominance of (Uc2) or duplex
         soils may vary locally
Cd27 Undulating lands with some areas of sandstone outcrop: dominant soils are shallow bleached gravelly sands
         (Uc2.12), which may have ironstone nodules or quartz gravel throughout the profile. Very shallow gritty
         sands (Uc1.21) occur adjacent to sandstone outcrops. Associated on longer slopes are moderately deep
         sandy grey earths (Gn2.81) and yellow earths (Gn2.21) with a prominent ironstone nodule horizon. Deep
         fine sandy loams (Uc5.21) occur on stream levees
Cd28 Very gently undulating plains; nearly all soils are normally underlain by a massive nodular laterite horizon
         at shallow to moderate depths (12-30 in.): dominant soils are bleached sands (Uc2.12), but other sands
         (Uc5.22, Uc5.23) are commonly associated. Also occurring are sandy earths (Gn2.81) and (Gn2.21), which,
         although mostly strongly nodular at depth (30-40 in.), do not normally have a massive laterite horizon;
         small areas of sandy red earths (Gn2.11) are also included. Where low scarped margins occur, particularly
         adjacent to deeper drainage lines, massive nodular laterite is usually exposed
Cd29 Level to very gently undulating plains: dominant soils are shallow to moderately deep bleached sands
         (Uc2.12) overlying massive laterite at 18-36 in. Associated soils include loamy red earths (Gn2.14) on the
         higher landscape sites and sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24), with lesser (Gn2.34), on lower slopes. Deep
         loamy duplex soils (Dy2.23), (Dy2.43), and (Dy3.43) occur in the broad concave drainage lines
Cd30 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with some low hilly areas; rock outcrop is common: dominant soils
         are shallow gravelly bleached sands or sandy loams (Uc2.12) with less commonly bleached loams (Um2.12).
         Chief associated soils are similar bleached sands and loams (Uc2.21), (Um2.2), (Um4.21), and (Um4.12).
         Small areas of sandy or loamy duplex soils of unit Va79 are included
Cd31 Hilly to high hilly lands with some limited mountainous areas; acid volcanic rock outcrop is common:
         dominant soils are very shallow gravelly bleached sands (Uc2.12), with lesser similar loams (Um2.12).
         Shallow to moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41, Dy3.42) and (Dy2.42) are minor associated soils
         occurring on lower slopes and in drainage lines. Data are limited
Cd32 Undulating lands with some low rocky hills; acid igneous rock outcrop is fairly common: dominant soils
         are shallow to moderately deep strongly bleached sands (Uc2.12). Minor associated soils include other
         shallow sands (Uc4.2), (Uc4.12), and (Uc2.22), occasional loamy yellow earths (Gn2.24), and shallow loamy
         duplex soils (Dy3.43, Dy3.42) on lower slopes. Some shallow loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.22) and (Dr2.12)
         occur on more basic rocks
Cd33 High hills and mountains with very steep scarped margins; large granite tor outcrop occupies a considerable
         part of the unit: dominant soils are probably shallow bleached sands (Uc2.12) but other sand soils such as
         (Uc4.1), (Uc4.2), and sandy grey earths (Gn2.84) also probably occur. Around the steep margins very
         shallow sands (Uc1.21) occur. Data are extremely limited
Cd34 Strongly undulating lands with some low hilly areas; granite tor outcrop is common: dominant soils are
         shallow to moderately deep bleached sands (Uc2.12), with lesser (Uc2.21, Uc2.23). Also occurring are
         other gritty sands (Uc4.11), gritty bleached duplex soils (Dr2.81), (Dy2.81), and (Dy3.81), and gritty grey
         earths (Gn2.84, Gn2.85, and Gn2.82). On some broad ridge crests there may be small areas of deep sandy
         red earths (Gn2.14), and on lower slopes and adjacent to drainage lines there are small areas of bleached
         duplex soils (Dy3.41, Dy3.42)
Cd35 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with high sandstone ridges and dissected low scarps: dominant
         soils on higher sites are probably shallow to moderately deep gravelly bleached sands (Uc2.12), with
         (Uc2.21) common where the sands are deeper. On lower and more gentle slopes loamy nodular bleached
         grey earths (Gn2.94) occur, and on some broad ridges there are areas of sandy yellow (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.24)
         or red earths (Gn2.14). Data are limited
Ca16 Strongly undulating or low hilly lands with some granite tor outcrop: dominant soils are shallow to
         moderately deep, often stony, gritty bleached sands (Uc2.21) and (Uc2.12); other sands (Uc4.1) and (Uc4.2)
         also occur. Common associated soils are gritty sandy or loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.61) and (Dr2.22),
         with lesser yellow duplex soils (Dy3.42) and (Dy2.22) on some lower slopes. On some outwash fans gritty
         red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15) may occur. Data are fairly limited
Ca17 Undulating outwash fans with occasional low stony granite hills: dominant soils are shallow to moderately
         deep (20 40 in.) gritty bleached sands (Uc2.21). Other sand soils are (Uc4.32) and (Uc2.12). Adjacent to
         most drainage lines are sandy or loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41, Dy3.42). The stony hills mostly have shallow
         (Uc2.12) soils with much rock outcrop. Data are fairly limited
Ca29 Gently undulating alluvial plains: dominant soils are deep nodular bleached sands (Uc2.21) occurring on
         stream levees. Associated are deep loamy earths (Gn2.41) and (Gn2.81) and sandy earths (Gn2.91, Gn2.94).

         cracking clays (Ug5.5)
Ca30 Undulating to moderately undulating lands with occasional low granite hills: dominant soils are moderately
         deep to deep coarse bleached sands (Uc2.21), with lesser (Uc4.22, Uc4.21); the latter may occasionally be
         locally dominant. Minor associated soils include sandy red or yellow earths (Gn2.15) and (Gn2.25), and
         loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42, Dy3.41) and (Dy2.42) that occur in the floors of the major drainage lines
Ca31 High hilly to mountainous lands with very steep slopes and much granite or other acid igneous rock outcrop:
        dominant soils are moderately deep to deep strongly bleached yellowy sands (Uc2.21), with other bleached  
        sands (Uc2.12) and (Uc3.21) closely associated. Also common are other uniform sands (Uc4.2), sandy
        red earths (Gn2.17), and similar red earths with a conspicuous bleach. Sandy or loamy duplex soils
        (Dy3.42), (Dr2.22), and (Dy2.22) occur on some lower slopes and in drainage lines. Data are limited
Ca32 Gently undulating outwash plains with some isolated low hills near the margins of the unit: dominant soils
         are moderately deep to deep bleached sands (Uc2.22), with similar sands (Uc2.12) and (Uc4.22, Uc4.21)
         closely associated. Included in the unit are small areas of shallow loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43), (Dy3.33),
         and dark cracking clays (Ug5.14, Ug5.13)
Ca33 Gently undulating to undulating lands with occasional low rocky hills; some granite tor outcrop also occurs
         on areas of lesser relief: dominant soils are moderately deep bleached sands, chiefly (Uc2.22) but with
         large areas of (Uc2.21) and lesser (Uc2.12) soils. Other shallow to moderately deep sands (Uc4.12) and
         (Uc4.21, Uc4.22) occur on higher slopes and adjacent to rock outcrop. A range of loamy duplex soils
         (Dr2.81), (Dr2.41), (Dr3.31), (Dr3.41), (Dy3.32), and (Dy3.43) occur on lower slopes. Included are small
         areas of loamy red or yellow earths of unit Mw46, chiefly (Gn2.14), with lesser (Gn2.15) and (Gn2.24)
Ca34 Strongly undulating lands with many low stony rises; granite tor outcrop is very common: dominant soils
         are shallow to moderately deep gritty bleached sands; (Uc2.22) is probably most common but (Uc2.21) and
         (Uc2.12) also occur widely. Other shallow sands (Uc4.21), (Uc4.11), and (Uc4.12) occur on the stony
         rises and adjacent to rock outcrop
Ca35 Hilly or high hilly lands with many sandstone mesas bounded by steep scarps; the area is often dissected by
         streams to form narrow steep-sided ravines and deep valleys; massive sandstone outcrop is often prominent:
         dominant soils are shallow to moderately deep gravelly bleached sands (Uc2.21), often with red subsoils.
         On more gentle dip slopes or more extensive plateau surfaces, sandy red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15, and
         Gn2.11) are common, with lesser sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24), (Gn2.34), and (Gn2.74). Duplex soils
         occur on some steeper slopes, particularly associated with shale outcrops, the chief forms being (Dy3.41),

         unit Fu25. Data are fairly limited
Ca36 Moderately or occasionally gently undulating lands with some low eroded sandstone mesas: dominant soils
         are deep bleached sands (Uc2.21). with associated leached sands (Uc4.22, Uc4.21). Shallower sands
         (Uc2.21) and (Uc2.12) occur on the eroded sandstone mesas. On broad ridge crests are areas of deep sandy
         red earths (Gn2.14), with sandy bleached mottled yellow earths (Gn2.74) usually associated downslope.
         In better-defined drainage depressions grey duplex soils (Dy3.42, Dy3.43) occur, also similar (Dy2) soils.
         Data are fairly limited

          shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.22), with other shallow sands (Uc4.12), (Uc2.12), and (Uc2.21) also probably
          occurring. On lower slopes the unit merges into the deep sandy red earths (Gn2.14) of unit Mw5O. Data
          are extremely limited
AA6 Hilly or high hilly lands, often with very steep slopes and always with numerous large granite tor outcrops:
         dominant soils are gritty brown sands of variable depth (Uc5.11). Commonly associated are other gritty
         sands (Uc2.21), (Uc4.2), (Uc2.22), and (Uc1.21) and coarse sandy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.14, and Gn2.15).

         mon on higher slopes: dominant soils are gravelly loams (Um4.21), with lesser (Um2.12). A range of loamy
         duplex soils is associated, chiefly (Dy3.42), (Dr3.32), (Dr3.42), (Dr3.31), and (Dr2.21); these may be locally
         dominant on areas of lesser relief. Moderately deep to deep loamy earths (Gn2.25), (Gn2.65), and (Gn2. 12)
         occur on gently sloping outwash fans

         loams (Um4.43); red friable loams (Um4.41) are also common and in some areas are locally dominant.
         Similar loamy soils (Um6.33, Um6.34, and Um6.32) are the chief associates in the southern part of the
         unit, while in the northern extremities uniform friable clays (Uf4.43 and Uf4.41) become increasingly com-
         mon. A range of moderately deep to deep friable earths (Gn3.74), (Gn3.71), (Gn3.54), (Gn3.14), and
         (Gn3.11) occur throughout the unit and are more common on the drier western slopes where the unit
         adjoins unit Mf17
LN2 High hills and mountains and the steep-scarped margins of unit LN1; slopes are very steep with much rock
         outcrop; most soils are shallow and very gravelly: dominant are friable loams (Um4.41) with lesser (Um4.43).
         Chief associated soils are a range of friable earths (Gn3.14), (Gn3.11), (Gn3.54), (Gn3.71), and (Gn3.74),
         with lesser loamy earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.44), and (Gn2.74). Shallow gravelly loams (Um4.12, Um4.11)
         are common on very steep slopes with much rock outcrop. Included in the unit, particularly along the
         eastern margins, are small areas of deep friable loams (Um6.34, Um6.33) of unit Gh1
Fa20 Undulating to strongly undulating lands with rock outcrop on crests and slopes: dominant soils are shallow
         gravelly loams (Um5.51) and (Um4.21), with (Um1.43) occurring on ridge crests. Loamy red duplex soils
         (Dr2.13) and red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13, and Gn2.16) are important associated soils on lower slopes and
         in valleys
Fa21 Undulating to moderately undulating lands with rock outcrop and gravel-strewn crests and slopes: dominant
         soils are very gravelly shallow loams (Um5.51), (Um4.1), and (Um4.21); associated soils on slopes are
         gravel-strewn loamy red earths (Gn2.15, Gn2.12, Gn2. 13, and Gn2.16), which in some areas may be locally
         dominant. Loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.13, Dr2.12) occur in lower sites together with occasional small
         areas of cracking clays (Ug5.22, Ug5.24)
Fa22 Gently undulating to undulating plains with extremely gravelly ridge crests: dominant soils are shallow
         gravelly loams (Um5.51), (Um4.22), (Um2.12), (K-Um5.51), and (K-Um4.2). Associated are loamy grey
         earths (Gn2.82, Gn2.83, and Gn2.81), red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.11), yellow earths (Gn2.21, Gn2.22), and
         brown earths (Gn2.42); these earths usually have quartz gravel on the surface and may be locally dominant.
         Areas of moderately deep grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.22) occur in lower sites, and also associated are
         gravel-strewn red friable earths (Gn3.13) and loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Dy2.13), (Dr2.12), and (Dy2.12)
Fa23 Undulating lands with broad crests and long slopes: dominant soils are very gravelly shallow loams (Um5.5 I )
         and (Um4.2), sometimes with ironstone nodules in the profile. Gravelly red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.11) and
         yellow earths (Gn2.22) are common associated soils. In lower sites are various gravel-strewn loamy duplex
         soils, chiefly (Dr2.13), (Dr3.12), and (Dr2.12), with similar (Dy) and (Db) soils; layers of quartz gravel may
         occur between 20 and 30 in. Small areas of deep cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.25) of unit CC69 occur
         throughout
Fa24 Gently undulating to undulating plains with massive nodular laterite often outcropping; occasional short
         steep rock-strewn scarps: dominant soils are shallow, extremely nodular, loams, chiefly (Um5.51), with
         associated (Um2.12), (Um4.1), (Um4.22), and (Um1.43). In lower areas are very nodular loamy earths
         (Gn2.61), (Gn2.81), (Gn2.82), (Gn2.42), (Gn2.21), (Gn2.14), (Gn2.11), and (Gn2.12). On lower scarp
         slopes are loamy duplex soils (Dr2.12), (Dr2.13), (Dr3.42), (Db1.12), (Dy2.13), and (Dy2.12). In depressions
         and drainage lines there are small areas of grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.22, Ug5.24). Stream levees
         have loamy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2. 11)
Fa25 Moderately undulating lands with much rock outcrop and quartz gravels: dominant soils are shallow gravel-
         strewn loams (Um5.51), with lesser (Um1.43), (Um4.1), (Um4.21), and shallow gravelly bleached loams
         (Um2. 12). On lesser slopes are gravelly-surfaced shallow to moderately deep loamy red duplex soils
         (Dr2.12, Dr2.13), with lesser (Db1.13). Some low areas have bleached loamy duplex soils (Dy2.4)
         and (Dy3.4). In isolated areas on lower slopes, loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2.12) and (Gn2.22) occur
Fa26 Strongly undulating lands with short steep slopes and much rock outcrop; some undulating outwash slopes:
         dominant soils are shallow stony red loams (Um5.51), with lesser (Um4.1) and (Um4.2). Associated soils
         on lower slopes are gravelly-surfaced moderately deep red duplex soils (Dr2.21); on stream levees are sandy
         red earths (Gn2.15) and lesser sandy yellow earths (Gn2.25)
Fa27 Undulating or occasionally strongly undulating lands: dominant soils are shallow stony red loams (Um5.51 ).
         Moderately deep loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.23) and (Dr2.13) are common on the more gently sloping
         country. Many of the gentle outwash slopes have moderate to strong linear gilgai; the soils are dominantly
         deep cracking clays (Ug5.16), (Ug5.25), (Ug5.12), and (Ug5.37), with loamy duplex soils (Dy3.13), (Dd1.13),
         and (Db1.13) also associated
Fb4 Alluvial plains associated with major streams: dominant soils are uniform loams (Um5.52) which may be
         stratified at depth. More recent levees have deep earthy sands (Uc5.2). Older levees and infilled stream
         channels have sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15). Small areas of loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33) and
         (Db1.33) may occur in lower sites. Data are very limited
Fb5 Stream levees and numerous old stream channels: dominant soils are deep earthy loams (Um5.52) that are
         usually stratified at depth. Associated on back slopes are brown earths (Gn2.41, Gn2.43) and (Gn2.53)
         and occasionally sandy red earths (Gn2.14). Away from the channels on the margins of the unit are some
         loamy grey duplex soils (Dy2.33) of unit Si12. More recent levees and terraces have deep sands (Uc5.22,
         Uc5.21) and (Uc4.31)
Fb6 Low delta plains merging into marine plains, salt pans, and mangroves: dominant soils are deep uniform
         loams (Um5.52), but large areas of dark loamy duplex soils (Dd1.33) and (Dd1.43) occur in swampy areas
         and on small included areas of marine plain. Brown earths (Gn2.43) and deep sands (Uc1.22) occur on
         more prominent levees, and saline clays (Uf6.62) occur on small areas of salt pans
Fb7 Delta plains dissected by numerous present and prior drainage lines and their associated levees: dominant
         soils are deep uniform loams (Um5.52), with lesser (Um5.42); both soils are usually stratified at depth.
         Levee soils are dominantly brown earths (Gn2.43), with sands (Uc1.22, Uc1.23) occurring on the higher
         levees and stranded beach ridges. Some areas of dark loamy duplex soils (Dd1.13) and (Dd1.33) occur
         in depressions and swampy areas
Gb15 Delta plains with small prior stream channels and associated levees: dominant are friable uniform-textured
         soils (Um6.11) with a very dark organic silt loam surface changing to earthy loamy material at depth.
         D horizons or other layered materials are frequently present at shallow depths. Some similar (Um4.2) and
         (Um5.5) soils also occur, and on the levee crests there are uniform sandy soils (Uc5.I l) and (Uc1.21)
Ge2 Gently to moderately undulating lands with low mesas having benched slopes and limestone outcrop:
         dominant soils are shallow soft loams (Um6.22), often with limestone gravels. Shallow gravelly calcareous
         loams (Um1.3), (Um1.1), and (Um5.11) occur on the bench margins. Associated on lower sites are grey
         cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.22), and on stream levees are loamy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13)
Gh1 Alluvial plains with prominent terrace systems adjacent to the major rivers; low levee banks, and relic channel
         cut-offs associated with numerous minor streams: dominant soils are deep friable yellow or yellowish
         red loams (Um6.34), with lesser red loams (Um6.33). Similar friable loams with a well-developed A2
         horizon (Um4.43, Um4.41) are particularly common in the northern occurrences of the unit. Loamy earths
         (Gn2.44), (Gn2.64), (Gn2.24), and (Gn2.14) are common on the levees and more recent terraces. The very
         short gently sloping pediments of adjoining hills are also included in the unit; these have loamy earths,
         chiefly (Gn2.14), but with (Gn2.24), (Gn2.64), (Gn2.74), and (Gn2.94) also common. Some loamy duplex
         soils (Dy3.41) and (Dy3.21) occur in slightly depressed areas. Also included are some isolated low hills
         with deep friable loams (Um4.43) of unit LN1
Io1 Salt pans and tidal flats inundated by seasonal high tides; numerous small tidal streams are usually closely
         associated, often fringed by mangrove swamps. The dominant soils are highly saline and often gypseous
         clays, usually with a very soft loose surface. The most common soil is probably (Uf6.51), but strongly
         mottled clays (Uf6.61, Uf6.62) are also prominent. Also occurring are saline strongly structured clays
         (Uf6.33) and (Uf6.41), and saline clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4) that crack when dry. These latter soils are less
         frequently inundated by tidal waters. Also included in the unit are small areas of slightly gilgaied cracking
         clays of unit II12, old beach ridges and sand dunes (units B35 and A20) too small to map separately, and
         small areas of eroded duplex soils (Dy3.33), (Dy3.13), and (Dy2.43)
Jb1 Salt pans and tidal flats or salt-water couch meadows merging into mangrove swamps; subject to frequent
         inundation by tidal waters: dominant soils on the salt pans are highly saline clays (Uf6.62), with some sandy
         duplex soils (Dy3.33), (Dy3.13), and (Dy2.43) on the margins. The duplex soils often have material added to
         or removed from the A horizons by wind or wave action. The small grassed areas in the unit have loamy
         duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), (Dd1.43), and (Dd1.33) or uniform clays (Uf6.41). Some areas of deep
         cracking clays (Ug5.14) and (Ug5.24) occur in minor depressions and various deep sands (Uc1.12), (Uc1.21),
         (Uc1.23), and (Uc4.2) occur on low included sand dunes or beach ridges
Ka5 Alluvial plains associated with spring-fed streams originating in basalt flows: dominant soils are friable
         cracking clays (Ug5.11), with a soft highly calcareous horizon occurring at variable depths below 24 in.
         Other deep cracking clays (Ug5.16, Ug5.17) are closely associated and may be locally dominant; some small
         areas of grey cracking clays (Ug5.24) also occur. Small areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12) of unit My37, red
         friable earths (Gn3.12) of unit Mo30, and cracking clays (Ug5.12) of unit Kb24 are included
Kb24 Level or gently undulating stony plains: dominant soils are dark clays of moderate depth (3 4 ft) that almost
         always have basalt surface stone to 12 in. diameter but often are stone-free below. The chief form is (Ug5.12)
         with very occasional deep soils (Ug5.16). Some areas of crabhole-type gilgai (8-12 in. deep) may occur.
         The plains are often terminated by low stony basalt flows or low hills with shallow (Um5.51) soils. Also
         mapped in the unit are small inclusions of red earths of unit My37
Kb26 Undulating lands with gently sloping plains, moderate to high, mostly stony, ridges, and some low stony
         basaltic hills: dominant soils are those of the plains and lower ridge slopes; these have dark clays (Ug5.12)
         of moderate depth and often display linear gilgai. Lower landscape sites have deep dark clays (Ug5.14).
         Also occurring are smaller areas of red-brown clays (Ug5.37). The higher ridges and low hills have rock
         outcrop and shallow stony soils, chiefly (Uf6.31), (Gn3.12), (Ug5.12), and (Ug5.37). Commonly associated
         on the ridges are thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dd1.43), and (Dr2.12)
Kb29 As for unit Kb24 but with inclusions of red friable earths (Gn3.12) of unit Mo30 rather than loamy red earths
         (Gn2.12) of unit My37
Kb30   Rocky scarps, low mesas, and undulating lands formed by stream dissection of basalt plateaux: dominant
        soils are very stony shallow to moderately deep dark cracking clays (Ug5.12). Included areas of deeper
        cracking clays (Ug5.16) are usually associated with broad gently sloping drainage lines, and similar soils
        (Ug5.17) with very marked depositional layering occur on the flood-plains of the major streams. Shallow
        gravelly loams (Um6.33) and clays (Uf6.31) occupy the steep scarps while red friable earths (Gn3.12) are
        common on the mesa remnants. Minor associated soils include a range of loamy duplex soils formed on
        various rocks exposed by dissection of the basalt
Kc10   Dissected basalt plateau with many low stony flow scarps; residual basalt gravels from 3 to 18 in. in diameter
        are common on the surface and throughout the profile of all soils: dominant soils are moderately deep to deep
        dark cracking clays (Ug5.13), with lesser (Ug5.14, Ug5.15); some deep (Ug5.17) soils occur on the small
        areas of alluvium. Red and brown friable earths and shallow gravelly loams of units Mo30 and Me9 occur on
        the low plateau remnants and scarps
Kf11   Alluvial plains with low levees and braided distributary channels: dominant soils are deep dark cracking
        clays (Ug5.16, Ug5.15), with smaller areas of grey clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.25). Commonly associated on slightly
        higher areas are loamy duplex soils (Dd2.33) and (Dd2.43), with (Dd1), (Dy2), and (Dr2) equivalents.
        Loamy earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.15), and (Gn2.44) occur on the low terraces. Some shallow dark or grey clays
        (Ug5.14), (Ug5.13), or (Ug5.22) occur where the clays have been deposited on very recent basalt flows
Kf12  Level swampy plain that occasionally may be flooded: dominant soils are deep, slightly gilgaied, dark cracking
        clays (Ug5.16). Associated marginally are dark loamy or silty duplex soils (Dd1.11), and occasionally
        mottled yellow-grey duplex soils (Dy3.41, Dy3.43)
Kf13   Level plains: dominant soils are deep dark cracking clays (Ug5.16), with lesser grey clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.29).
        A slight (6 12 in.) gilgai microrelief is often present; where it is more pronounced, the clays occur on the
        puffs, and in the depressions are loamy grey duplex soils (Dy3.43), (Dy2.43), (Dy3.33), and (Dy2.33), with
        lesser similar (Dd1) soils

        grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.22, Ug5.24, and Ug5.25). Associated are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.13,
        Dy2.12), (Dy3.12), (Db1.13, Db1.12), and (Db2.13). On the gravelly rises are moderately deep loamy
        nodular brown or yellow earths (Gn2.44, Gn2.43) and (Gn2.21); on lower slopes of the rises are loamy red
        duplex soils (Dr2.12, Dr2.11) and (Dr3.42)
CB11 Undulating or occasionally moderately undulating lands with long slopes and broad ridge crests: dominant
         soils are moderately deep grey cracking clays (Ug5.22), with lesser (Ug5.26) and (Ug5.12). In lower sites
         deeper clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.16) occur. On some higher ridge crests small areas of gravelly red soils
         (Gn2.12), (Gn3.12), and (Dr2.12) occur. Around the margin of the unit are small areas of grey duplex soils
         (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.43)

         deep yellowish grey cracking clays (Ug5.26). Associated are similar grey (Ug5.22) or brown (Ug5.33) clays,
         and occasionally massive forms (Ug5.5). Throughout the unit there are usually smaller areas of slightly
         gilgaied friable yellow or brown earths (Gn3.51) and (Gn3.71)
CC31 Level plains with a well-developed broad shallow (12-18 in.) gilgai microrelief. A complex of soils occurs:
         the puffs and roughly circular depressions have cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.29), sometimes with (Ug5.34,
         Ug5.38) on the puffs. The intervening shelf areas have thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33) and occa-
         sionally (Dr2.33). Also occurring in the unit, as mapped, are some level non-gilgaied clay plains (Ug5.24,
         Ug5.29); other duplex soils (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), and (Dd1.33) which often occur as clay pans; and occasional
         areas of sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.12)
CC63 Gently undulating plains with very gravelly (chert) low rises and some limestone or dolomite outcrops;
         some shallow gilgais may occur: dominant soils are deep grey or brown clays (Ug5.25, Ug5.24), and
         (Ug5.34), with lesser (Ug5.23, Ug5.22). Associated on very gravelly areas are shallow-surfaced loamy
         duplex soils (Db1.13), (Dr2.12), (Dr2.43), and (Dr2.33) and occasionally gravelly-surfaced clays (Uf6.33)

         calcareous throughout. Other loamy duplex soils (Dy2. 13) and (Db 1 . 13) also occur; these may be wind-eroded
         areas
CC65 Alluvial plains with many braided distributary stream channels, old levees, and infilled channels: dominant
         soils are deep grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.25, Ug5.24); on levees and old filled channels are deep loamy
         red earths (Gn2.13) with some carbonate nodules throughout the profile. Adjacent to stream levees and on
         scalded areas are thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy2.13), (Dy2.33), (Dr2.13), and (Db1.13). Small areas

         loamy red earths (Gn2.12), with lesser (Gn2.42), and deep loams (Um5.52). Fringing the clays are loamy
         duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Db1.13), and (Dy2.13), which are often scalded. Some smaller levees have deep
         uniform clays (Uf6.31) and (Uf6.51). Deep sandy red earths (Gn2.13, Gn2.12) occasionally occur in old

CC72 Alluvial clay plains with small isolated areas of sands and earths of unit AC20: dominant soils are deep
         grey-brown and grey cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.28), with lesser (Ug5.25). Some areas have a slight gilgai
         microrelief. Associated are loamy duplex soils (Dy2.13), (Dr2.13), and (Db1.13) and loamy yellow earths
         (Gn2.21); these often occur as scalded areas on the eastern margin of the unit
CC73 Very gently undulating plains; occasional areas have a slight gilgai microrelief: dominant soils are deep
         grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.24), with lesser (Ug5.28). Near the margins of the unit some non-cracking
         clays (Uf6.33) occur; small scalded areas have loamy duplex soils (Dy2.13) and (Db1.13)
CC74 Level alluvial plains with slight to moderate gilgai microrelief (12-24 in.): dominant soils are deep grey
         cracking clays (Ug5.24), with lesser (Ug5.28). Loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33) and (Dy3)
         equivalents are the chief associated soils. These occur either as the depression soil of the weaker gilgaied
         areas or on flat, slightly higher, areas. Minor associated soils include loamy earths (Gn2.14) and (Gn2.44)
         on low stream levees and occasional friable earths (Gn3.53) and (Gn3.83)
CC75 Gently undulating plains: dominant soils are deep grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.24, Ug5.25). Associated
         are a range of loamy duplex soils (Db1.33), (Db1.13), (Dy2.33), and (Dy2.13), often occurring as scalded
         areas. At the margins gravelly loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.13) often occur. Old levees and outwash areas
         have loamy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13), with occasional associated loamy duplex soils (Dy2.13), (Db1.13),

         present: dominant soils of the gilgai mounds and level sites are deep grey cracking clays (Ug5.28),
         occasionally (Ug5.24). The depressions usually have massive cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4) or dark
         loamy duplex soils (Dd1.13). At the seaward margin the clay plains merge into salt pans of unit Iol; these
         also occur adjacent to small tidal streams. Small sandy old beach ridges or dunes with (Uc) soils also occur
         near the coast, while inland margins of the unit have loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33), (Dy3.33), (Dy2.13), and
         (Dy3.13) and occasionally (Ug3.2) soils
MM5 Gently undulating clay plains with a slight (few in.) gilgai microrelief. Where the unit is exposed by stream
         erosion in deep wide valleys, topography may be strongly undulating and much dissected. Brown clays
         (Ug5.32) of moderate depth (30-36 in.) are dominant, but similar grey clays (Ug5.26, Ug5.22) are also
         common. The soils often contain much gypsum. In some areas, particularly adjacent to lateritic scarps or
         eroded lateritic mesa-like hills, red-brown clays (Ug5.37, Ug5.38) are locally prominent, together with small
         areas of red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.33). Throughout the unit there are local areas where a veneer of billy
         gravel is prominent. Associated lower-level plains or small stream flood-plains have deeper clay soils,
         chiefly (Ug5.28, Ug5.29, and Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34)
MM25 Alluvial plains with many old channels and levees: chief soils are deep brown and grey-brown cracking clays
         (Ug5.34, Ug5.35) and (Ug5.24, Ug5.25), varying locally in dominance. Some uniform non cracking clays
         (Uf6.31, Uf6.33) also occur. On old channels and levees are deep loamy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13), with
         lesser (Gn2.42, Gn2.43). Associated with these are areas of loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Db1.13), and
         (Dy2.13), which are often scalded. Some small depressions have massive cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4)

         are deep massive mottled grey cracking clays (Ug5.5), with closely associated (Ug5.4) and (Ug5.28, Ug5.24);
         lesser areas of (Ug5.6), (Ug5.16), and (Ug3.2) soils also occur. Marginal to the clays are the loamy duplex
         soils (Dy2.33), (Dy2.13), (Db1.33), (Dy2.43), (Dy3.33), (Db1.43), and (Dr2.33) of unit Si12. The infilled

Mz29 Elevated undulating plateaux with stepped marginal slopes or steep scarped margins: dominant soils are
         deep loamy or occasionally sandy red earths (Gn2.11), which may have ironstone nodules in the profile.
         Near the margins massive nodular laterite often occurs. Marginal to the red earths and in lower sites are
         small areas of very gravelly nodular loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21), and shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.2) and
         loams (Um4.2) with some sandstone outcrop. Deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43) occur in local depressions

        bleached sands (Uc2.21, Uc2.22); the ironstone nodules may be cemented to form massive nodular laterite.
        Near the dissected margins other sands occur, chiefly (Uc4.11) and (Uc1 .23) overlying sandstone at shallow
        depths. Some associated larger streams have levees with loamy red earths (Gn2.15) or fine sands (Uc4.2)
Mz31 Low hilly to hilly lands with very occasional conical basalt peaks: dominant soils are moderately deep to
         deep loamy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.14), but are closely associated with similar red friable earths (Gn3.11,

         loamy or sandy red earths (Gn2.11), with shallower gravelly red earthy sands (Uc5.21) occurring on more
         dissected areas. Occasional higher sandstone mesas have shallower bleached sands (Uc2.21) of unit Ca35.
         The undulating outwash fans have deep sandy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.14), sandy mottled yellow earths
         (Gn2.64) and (Gn2.74), and areas of deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) on lower slopes and in broad drainage
         depressions. Data are fairly limited

         occasionally sandy red earths (Gn2.11), with (Gn2.14) also occurring. Similar loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21,
         Gn2.24) are common on lower slopes. On more extensive undulating low plateaux there are small areas of
         loamy red friable earths (Gn3.11). In small drainage depressions throughout the unit deep bleached sands
         of unit Ca43 are common

         Uc2.21) and (Uc2.12), with other shallow sands (Uc4.12) and (Uc4.22, Uc4.21) common on higher slopes
         and adjacent to rock outcrop. Moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42), (Dy3.22), and (Dr2.22) occur
         on some lower slopes. Small areas of loamy grey earths (Gn2.94) of unit MT14 are included
Mw47 Hilly to high hilly lands with very steep slopes and much large granite tor outcrop: dominant soils are deep
         friable-surfaced loamy red earths (Gn2. 14), with lesser friable red earths (Gn3. 14); the latter are occasionally
         locally dominant. Areas of other loamy earths including (Gn2.24), (Gn2.74), (Gn2.84), (Gn2.94), and
         (Gn2.21) are common. Shallow Fitty sands (Uc4.12), (Uc4.21), and (Uc2.12) occur adjacent to rock out-
         crop, and deep loamy earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.24), and (Gn2.64) are common on the lower pediment slopes.
         Small areas of the deep friable loams (Um6.34) of unit Gh1 are included
Mw48 Strongly undulating to low hilly lands with occasional sandstone mesas: dominant soils are deep sandy
         red earths, chiefly (Gn2.14) with lesser (Gn2.11). On lower more gentle slopes sandy yellow earths (Gn2.34)
         and (Gn2.74) may occur. On the sandstone hills and mesas are shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.22) and (Uc2.21),
         and on the dissected scarps and steep upper slopes sandy duplex soils (Dy2.61), (Dy5.41), and (Dr5.41) are
         often common
Mw49 Gently undulating old stream levees and small alluvial plains, often dissected and eroded by small streams:
         dominant soils are loamy red earths (Gn2.14), with lesser (Gn2.15). At the margins of the levees loamy red
         duplex soils (Dr3.41, Dr3.42) occur; the small alluvial plains have alkaline yellow duplex soils (Dy3.43)
Mw50 Gently undulating to broadly undulating plains: dominant soils are deep sandy red earths (Gn2.14), with
         very occasional (Gn2.15, Gn2.11). On the long gentle slopes a catenary sequence of soils is often present;
         red earths occupy the upper and middle slopes, below these is a narrow zone of sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24),
         occasionally (Gn2.34), (Gn2.64), or mottled duplex soils (Dy4.81), then a wider zone of sandy mottled
         yellow or grey earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.94). At the base of the slope deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) often
         occur. Most soils except the red earths have a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at depth. Small valley
         floors and well-defined drainage depressions have sandy or loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43, Dy2.42) and (Dy3.43,
         Dy3.42), and occasionally bleached grey earths (Gn2.94, Gn2.95). Adjacent to some larger streams are
         areas of deep red sands (Uc5.22), and where the unit adjoins unit Ca42 deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) occur
Mw51 Very gently undulating plains forming the surface of an extensive low plateau; small scarps occur at the
         margins of the plateau. A feature of the unit is the virtual absence of defined drainage channels: dominant
         soils are deep sandy red earths (Gn2.14), only rarely with ironstone nodules at depth. Occasional (Gn2.11,
         Gn2.15) soils also occur. Associated in lower landscape sites are small areas of sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24)
Mw52 Gently undulating to undulating lands; in some areas the unit occurs as low plateau remnants with strongly
         undulating dissected marginal scarps: dominant soils on higher landscape sites are loamy or sandy red
         earths (Gn2.14), occasionally (Gn2.15, Gn2.11). Similar yellowish red earths (Gn2.24) occur on more gentle
         slopes and often are locally dominant. Both the red and the yellow earths are strongly nodular at depth,
         and occasionally pisolitic in some localities; on some slopes there are outcrops of massive nodular laterite.
         On lower slopes and small level plains loamy nodular mottled yellow earths (Gn2.61, Gn2.64) commonly
         occur, with bleached yellow or grey earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.94) occurring in better-defined drainage
         depressions. In the north-west parts of the unit some drainage lines have deep bleached sands (Uc2.21),
         and in the south-west areas loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42) occur in the well-defined drainage depressions.
         In some areas small circular swampy depressions are common; these have loamy bleached yellow or grey
         earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.94), and normally have a horizon of massive nodular laterite within the profile
Mw53 Broadly undulating lands: dominant soils are deep sandy red earths (Gn2.14), occasionally (Gn2.11). The
         soils often have ironstone nodules at depth and on some slopes or very low scarps there are outcrops of
         massive nodular laterite. On lower slopes and in drainage depressions deep sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24),
         (Gn2.34), and (Gn2.74) are common, with occasional bleached grey earths (Gn2.94). On some ridge crests
         are deep bleached sands (Uc2.21)
Mw54 Strongly undulating to low hilly lands with some dissected low sandstone mesas: dominant soils are sandy
         or loamy deep to moderately deep red earths (Gn2. 14), with some areas of (Gn2. 11 ) and occasional (Gn2.24).
         The soils are often nodular at depth and in some areas massive nodular laterite outcrops. On steeper slopes
         and on the low mesa scarps shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.22) occur. On small valley plains there are some
         areas of loamy mottled yellow earths (Gn2.64). Data are limited
Mw55 Undulating or occasionally strongly undulating elevated lands with steep strongly dissected scarped margins:
         dominant soils are probably sandy or occasionally loamy red earths (Gn2.14), but other sandy earths
         (Gn2.24), (Gn2.74), and (Gn2.94) are commonly associated. At the scarped margins of the unit, sandstone
         is exposed with shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.22, Uc4.21). Data are very limited
Mw56 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with some high stony ridges or low hills: dominant soils are sandy
         or occasionally loamy nodular red earths (Gn2.14), with lesser (Gn2.11). On higher ridges the soils are
         also gravelly and may have ferruginous sandstone or massive nodular laterite outcrop. On more gentle
         slopes sandy yellow or yellowish red earths (Gn2.24, Gn2.21) are common, with (Gn2.64) less common.
         In the numerous shallow drainage depressions deep bleached sands of unit Ca43 occur, chiefly (Uc2.21),
         but occasionally (Uc2.20) and (Uc2.33, Uc2.31). On some higher stony ridges and low hills shallow gravelly
         sands (Uc4.21, Uc4.22) occur
Mu13 Gently undulating plains with some shallow drainage lines: dominant soils are moderately deep to deep
         loamy red earths (Gn2.15, Gn2.12, and Gn2.13); the soils may contain some quartz gravel. Associated soils
         are nodular loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22, Gn2.21) and (Gn2.62). Loamy grey earths (Gn2.82, Gn2.81)
         and occasional loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42) occur in shallow drainage depressions. Data are limited
Mu14 Alluvial plains with old flood channels and small terraces: dominant soils are fine sandy red earths (Gn2.15),
         with associated (Gn2.11) and (Gn2.25, Gn2.22). On levees close to the stream channels are deep earthy fine
         sands (Uc5.21, Uc5.22)
Mu15 Level alluvial plains with numerous old meander channels and terraces, often dissected by many recent
         small streams: dominant are loamy red earths (Gn2.15), with closely associated (Gn2.14) and (Gn2.24,
         Gn2.25). Loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.33), (Dy2.43), (Dy3.33), (Dy3.43), (Dr2.23), (Dr2.43), and
         occasional (Db1) equivalents, are common on the back slopes of the levees and the higher alluvial plains.
         In areas where the levee is very narrow the (Dr2.23) soils may be locally dominant. Deep cracking clays
         (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.16) occur on the lower back slopes of the flood-plain
Mu16 Gently undulating to undulating outwash slopes with some isolated granite outcrops: dominant soils are
          moderately deep to deep loamy red earths (Gn2.15), with lesser (Gn2.14). Chief associated soils are moder-
          ately deep coarse sands (Uc2.22, Uc2.23, and Uc2.21); occasionally these may be locally dominant. Loamy
          yellow earths (Gn2.25, Gn2.24) and (Gn2.34) are common on poorly drained foot slopes and loamy duplex
          soils (Dy3.43), (Dy2.42), (Dy3.42), and (Dy5.42) occur on small alluvial plains. Shallow gritty sands (Uc4.21)
          and (Uc4.11) occur adjacent to rock outcrop. Small areas of loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.21) of unit Pb34
          are also included
Mu17 Gently undulating plains with only occasional, very shallow, drainage depressions; the eastern margin of
          the unit may have low scarps: dominant soils are deep loamy yellowish red earths that are pisolitic
          (bauxitic) throughout the profile and below approximately 20 in. contain high concentrations of bauxite
          pisolites in a loose earthy matrix. Occasionally the pisolites are cemented to form irregular bauxite masses.
          Neutral soils (Gn2.15) are probably most common but acid forms (Gn2.14) are also associated, particularly
          towards the eastern margins of the unit where bauxite pisolites are less abundant and ironstone nodules
          tend to be dominant. The soils have a weakly gradational profile and are tending to (Um4.21). Occasionally
          associated on level sites are similar pisolitic yellow or red earths (Gn2.24, Gn2.25) and (Gn2.12, Gn2.11),
          while in the shallow drainage depressions nodular or pisolitic yellow or grey earths (Gn2.25), (Gn2.64),
          (Gn2.74), and (Gn2.94) occur
Ms6 Undulating lands with broad shallow depressions: dominant soils of the higher landscape sites are loamy
          yellow earths (Gn2.21) and (Gn2.61). On lower slopes loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.42) occur, and in
          the broad depressions (Dy2.43) soils are most common. Included in the unit, as mapped, are small inclusions
          of unit Cd17 and small areas of loamy red earths (Gn2.12)
Ms16 Gently undulating outwash plains; occasional low rises with massive nodular laterite on margins and some
          areas of channels, levees, and flats associated with streams: dominant soils are deep sandy and loamy
          yellow earths (Gn2.21, Gn2.22), usually with ironstone nodules at depth. On lower areas are sandy and
          loamy grey earths (Gn2.81) and (Gn2.94) and some massive yellow mottled duplex soils (Dy3.81). On the
          low rises are shallow sands with ironstone nodules (Uc5.22), (Uc4.21), (Uc4.1), and (Uc4.22) overlying
          massive nodular laterite. Adjacent to streams are deep loamy brown or red earths (Gn2.42) and (Gn2.12)
          and occasionally deep red sands (Uc5.21) on the levees
Ms17 Gently undulating to undulating plains with massive nodular laterite occurring near low scarp margins:
          dominant soils are shallow lo moderately deep sandy or loamy nodular yellow earths (Gn2.21, Gn2.22).
          Associated near the marginal scarps are sandy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.12) and shallow nodular loams
          (Um5.51). Occasional sandy grey earths (Gn2.81, Gn2.82) occur in lower sites
Ms18 Gently undulating plains: dominant soils are deep sandy yellow earths (Gn2.21), with lesser (Gn2.64) and
      (Gn2.74). Some sandy red earths (Gn2.11) are associated. On small scalded areas are quartz-gravel-strewn
        loamy-surfaced brown duplex soils (Db1.33). Less commonly, grey duplex soils (Dy2.31) with ironstone
        nodules in the profile also occur. Occasionally near old stream channels are deep sands (Uc4.2) and (Uc5.22,
        Uc5.21)
Ms19 Gently undulating to undulating plains with low laterite scarps: dominant soils are shallow to moderately
         deep loamy yellow earths (Gn2.21) with many ironstone nodules in the profile. Associated are other strongly
         nodular earths (Gn2.61), (Gn2.74), and (Gn2.11, Gn2.14). Shallow extremely nodular loams (Um5.51) and
         (Um4.22) are common near the scarped margins. On the lower slopes of scarps are loamy duplex soils
         (Dy3.13), (Dy2.13), (Dr2.13), and (Db1.13), with some yellow earths (Gn2.23) and (Gn2.62) also occurring
Ms20 Gently undulating plains with some narrow well-defined drainage depressions: dominant soils are sandy
         yellow earths (Gn2.21), with occasional (Gn2.24) and (Gn2.34). Associated low rises have sandy red earths
         (Gn2.14, Gn2.11) and occasionally extremely nodular earthy sands (Uc5.21) or grey earths (Gn2.81) over-
         lying massive nodular laterite. Bleached sands (Uc2.21) may also occur. In the shallow drainage depressions
         sandy or loamy grey earths occur, chiefly (Gn2.81, Gn2.82) and (Gn2.94), and occasionally grey duplex
         soils (Dy2.42, Dy2.43)
MS8 Gently undulating plains with broad shallow drainage depressions: a wide range of loamy yellow earths and
         related soils occur but (Gn2.22) is probably most common. On higher landscape sites (Gn2.21, Gn2.24, and
         Gn2.25) are commonly associated. In slightly depressed areas (Gn2.35), (Gn2.95), (Gn2.34), and (Gn2.55) all
         may occur locally. All of these earth soils commonly contain a horizon of ironstone nodules at 30-36 in. and
         occasionally at shallower depths
MS12 Very gently undulating plains with some low rises with gravels and massive nodular laterite: dominant soils
         are shallow to moderately deep loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22), (Gn2.62, Gn2.61), and (Gn2.23). Common
         associated soils are loamy grey or brown earths (Gn2.81), (Gn2.94), (Gn2.41), and occasionally (Gn2.14).
         Ironstone nodules usually occur in the profile and sometimes massive nodular laterite occurs at shallow
         depths. On the low rises are shallow nodular loams (Um5.51), (Um4.22), and (Um1.1). In depressions
         loamy duplex soils (Dr2.13), (Db1.13), and (Dy2.13) occur associated with grey-brown cracking clays
         (Ug5.22, Ug5.24, and Ug5.25)
MS13 Undulating to gently undulating lands with broad low rises: dominant soils are nodular loamy yellow earths
         (Gn2.22), with lesser (Gn2.24). Associated are some red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.11), mostly on higher sites.
         Also occurring, particularly on high ridge crests or adjacent to dissected drainage lines, are inclusions of
         unit Qb41, with gravelly shallow to moderately deep duplex soils (Dr2.22, Dr2.21), (Dr2.12), (Dy2.21,
         Dy2.22), and (Dy2.61). Small basic intrusions have (Gn3.12) soils of unit Mo29 and occasional areas of
         dark clays (Ug5.14)
MS14 Gently undulating plains: dominant soils are moderately deep loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22, Gn2.21), with
         associated loamy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.11). In slightly lower sites are loamy grey earths (Gn2.82) and
         bleached grey earths (Gn2.95). Deep loamy red earths (Gn2. 12) occur on small alluvial plains and stream levees
Mr9 Gently undulating plains with low moderately steep-scarped margins: dominant soils are loamy yellow earths
         (Gn2.24) with a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at approximately 30 in. Associated are sandy yellow
         earths (Gn2.24) and some red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.11). In lower sites are loamy and sandy mottled yellow
         earths (Gn2.61) and (Gn2.74)
Mr10 Gently undulating to undulating lands occupying broad shallow valleys: dominant soils are moderately
         deep loamy and sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24), usually with prominent ironstone nodules at depth. Assoc-
         iated are shallow sands (Uc4.2) and sandy and loamy grey earths (Gn2.81). On scalded areas are moderately
         deep bleached loamy grey earths (Gn2.95) and shallow bleached sands (Uc2.3); usually these overlie a
         prominent ironstone nodule horizon. Small stream levees have loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2. 11, Gn2. 14)
         and (Gn2.21)
Mr11 Gently undulating plains consisting of low very broad sandy rises and many sharply defined shallow drainage
         depressions that become less prominent in the northern parts of the unit. Well-defined swamps are also a
         feature. The dominant soils of the rises are sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24), with lesser (Gn2.25), (Gn2.34),
         and (Gn2.74). Other sandy earths (Gn2.84, Gn2.85), (Gn2.54), and occasionally (Gn2.94) are commonly
         associated. Some soils have ironstone nodules at depth. On higher ridges there may be areas of sandy red
         earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15) or deep sands (Uc4.22) and (Uc5.22). On some lower slopes adjacent to the drain-
         age depressions deep sandy duplex soils (Dy5.81) or deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) occur. The drainage
         depressions have sandy to loamy grey duplex soils (Dy3.43, Dy3.42) and (Dy2.43, Dy2.42) and bleached
         grey earths (Gn2.94, Gn2.95). Small areas of units TM1 and Va87 are included
Mr12 Gently undulating outwash slopes and fans: dominant soils are deep loamy yellow earths (Gn2.24), with
         lesser (Gn2.21) and very occasional loamy red earths (Gn2.14). Loamy duplex soils (Dy2.23), (Dy2.43),
         (Dy3.23), and (Dy3.43) occur in slight depressions and in the minor drainage lines. Data are limited
Mr13 Gently undulating lands with short even slopes to the drainage lines: dominant soils are deep loamy yellow
         earths (Gn2.24), with lesser red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.11) on the higher broad ridge crests. Some bleached
         loamy yellow earths (Gn2.34) occur on the lower slopes; loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.33), (Dy2.43),
         (Db1.33), and (Dy3) equivalents, occur in the minor drainage lines. Included also are small areas of shallow
         leached sands of unit Cd29
Mr14 Very gently undulating low lateritic plateau with long gentle slopes to drainage lines: loamy yellow earths
         (Gn2.24) are the dominant soils but there are also large areas of loamy red earths, chiefly (Gn2.14) but with
         some (Gn2.11), on the broad ridge crests and higher slopes. Loamy or occasionally sandy duplex soils
         (Dy3.41), (Dy3.42), and (Dy2) equivalents occur adjacent to drainage lines and in localized internal drainage
         depressions. Shallow gravelly loams (Um4.12) and (Um4.21) occur on the low lateritic scarps bordering
         the unit
Mr15 Strongly undulating to low hilly lands with some large granite tor outcrop: moderately deep to deep loamy
         yellow earths (Gn2.24) are probably dominant, but associated are important areas of red earths (Gn2.14)
         lesser (Gn2.11), and occasional (Gn2.74). Loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), (Dy3.21), and (Dr3.21) occur on
         lower slopes, while shallow bleached sands (Uc2.21, Uc2.22) and (Uc2.12), and other shallow sands (Uc4.21
        Uc4.22) are common on higher slopes and adjacent to rock outcrop. Loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2.14)
        and (Gn2.24) occur on the occasional small lateritic mesas, while friable earths (Gn3.12), (Gn3.22), and
        shallow friable loams (Um6.33) are common on small basalt mesas that are also included in the unit
Mr16 Moderately to strongly undulating elevated plateau: dominant soils are probably deep loamy yellow earths
         (Gn2.24) but deep yellow friable earths (Gn3.74) also occupy large areas. Minor associated soils include
         other loamy earths (Gn2.44), (Gn2.84), and (Gn2.14) and also friable earths (Gn3.84), (Gn3.94), and
         (Gn3.04). Small areas of red friable earths (Gn3.11) occur on basic rocks
Mr17 Slightly elevated old beach ridges inland from the coastline: dominant soils are slightly compacted sandy
         yellow earths (Gn2.24), with bleached forms (Gn2.34) also occurring. At moderate depths the soils Fade
         to loose sands. Associated are small areas of salt pans of unit Io1 and deep grey cracking clays of unit 1112.
         Data are limited
Mr18 Very gently undulating plains, occasionally with low scarped margins. The unit is similar to and grades into
         unit Mr11 but the drainage depressions are much fewer and less well defined; small well-defined swamps
         are again a feature in parts of the unit: dominant soils are deep sandy yellow earths (Gn2.24), often with
         yellowish red subsoils. The chief associated soils are sandy or occasionally loamy red earths (Gn2.14) on
         slightly higher level surfaces, and sandy bleached grey or yellow earths (Gn2.94), (Gn2.74), and (Gn2.34) on
         weakly dissected slopes to the drainage depressions. The earth soils may occasionally have ironstone nodules
         at depth. The drainage depressions have similar soils to those occurring in unit Mr11
Mr19 Gently undulating alluvial plains associated with major streams. The unit is often dissected by many stream
         channels and parts are subject to seasonal flooding: dominant soils are probably sandy or loamy yellow
         earths (Gn2.24), which occur on low rises, but also common are slightly higher rises of similar red earths
         (Gn2.14). In areas subject to flooding adjacent to the stream channels stratified loams (Um4.23) usually
         occur. On the broader flood-plains small drainage depressions have loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42) and (Dd2.32).
         Data are very limited
Mr20 Strongly undulating lands with some low hilly areas: a complex pattern of soils is present but dominant are
         probably sandy or loamy yellowish red earths (Gn2.24), which occur on the middle and upper slopes.
         Associated with them are (Gn2.25) and (Gn2.74) soils. On broad high ridge crests sandy or loamy red earths
         (Gn2.14, Gn2.11, Gn2.15, and Gn2.12) are common, and on lower slopes and valley floors loamy mottled
         yellow earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.64) are common. Included in the unit are low hilly areas of granite or
         gneiss with (Dr2.61), (Dr2.21), (Dy2.21), and (Uc4.22) soils. Data are limited
Mr21 Moderately to occasionally strongly undulating lands, often with long gentle slopes; the strongly undulating
         areas may have low laterite or sandstone scarps: dominant soils are deep sandy yellowish red earths (Gn2.24),
         with sandy red earths (Gn2.14) and, less commonly, (Gn2.11), usually occurring on ridge crests. All soils
         normally have a prominent ironstone nodule horizon below approximately 30 in. and massive nodular
         laterite may occur at variable depths within the profile. On lower slopes deep sands (Uc4.21, Uc4.22) often
         occur and shallow gravelly or nodular sands (Uc4.21) and (Uc4.12) occur near the low scarps. Throughout
         the unit there are small plains fringing drainage lines; these have deep bleached sands of unit Ca43, or
         occasionally deep sandy bleached earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.94)
MR2 Alluvial terraces and gently sloping levees associated with major rivers: dominant soils are fine sandy earths
         (Gn2.25), occasionally (Gn2.52), that may tend weakly pedal at depth. On the back levee slopes sandy duplex
         soils (Dr2.22) occur together with some inclusions of loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33), (Dy2.43), or (Dy3.33)
MR3 Gently undulating lands with some level plains; in some areas the unit may have a marginal strongly
         dissected scarp: dominant soils are moderately deep loamy yellow earths (Gn2.25), with lesser red earths
         (Gn2.14). Laterite outcrops around the margins of the unit where loamy red earths (Gn2.15, Gn2.14) are
         more common, while nodular sands (Uc4.3), (Uc4.1), (Uc2.12), and (Um) equivalents are common on the
         dissected scarps. In minor depressions and drainage lines throughout the unit moderately deep loamy duplex
         soils occur, chiefly (Dy3.43), (Dy3.22), (Dy3.32), and (Dy2) equivalents; all are strongly nodular at depth
MR4 Very gently undulating outwash plains with very broad drainage depressions: dominant soils are loamy
         or sandy earths, chiefly yellow earths (Gn2.25), but with areas of (Gn2.24) and similar red earths (Gn2.14,
         Gn2.15) and occasional mottled yellow earths (Gn2.64) and (Gn2.74). Associated soils include loamy
         duplex soils (Dy3:41), (Dy3.43), (Dy5.41), and (Dr2.22); deep bleached sands (Uc2.22), (Uc2.21), (Uc2.3);
         and very occasional friable yellow earths (Gn3.75). Small areas of deep cracking clays of unit Kf11 may
         also be included
MR5 Gently undulating alluvial plains with many old stream channels and shallow lagoons, old levees, and infilled
         prior stream channels; much of the area may be inundated by high floods. A complex array of soils is
         present; loamy yellow earths (Gn2.25), with lesser (Gn2.24), are probably dominant, and occur on the
         broader terraces and levees and slightly elevated old flood-plains. Associated with them are other yellow
         earths (Gn2.34), (Gn2.65), and (Gn2.74), with loamy red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15) occurring on slightly
         higher sites and adjacent to some stream channels. More recent stream levees and areas subject to more
         frequent flooding have uniform loams (Um4.23) and (Um3.2), or earthy sands (Uc5.22). Associated through-
         out the unit, more particularly in the north, are slightly lower old flood-plains with loamy or silty grey
         duplex soils (Dy3.42, Dy3.43). Old sand-filled channels occurring throughout the unit usually have deep
         bleached sands (Uc2.21). Other undescribed soils are probably present in the unit
MR6 Gently undulating plains with only occassional shallow drainage depressions; the eastern margin of the unit
          may have low scarps: the soils of the unit are very similar to those of unit Mu17, but dominant are loamy
          yellowish red to reddish yellow pisolitic (bauxitic) earths (Gn2.25), with similar (Gn2.24), (Gn2.15), (Gn2.22),
          and (Gn2.14) soils associated. The pisolitic bauxite occurs as in the soils of unit Mu17, occasionally massive
          pisolitic bauxite outcrops. In the shallow drainage depressions the chief soils are nodular mottled yellow
          earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.61, Gn2.64)
MK1 Alluvial delta plains with a complex pattern of present and prior stream channels and levees: dominant soils
         are loamy or fine sandy brown earths (Gn2.42) which occur on the older and flatter levees. Associated soils
         include (Gn2.43), (Um5.42), and (Um5.52), all usually strongly stratified at depth. The younger levees have
         coarse uniform sands, chiefly (Uc1.23, Uc1.22), but with some (Uc5.22) and (Uc1.21). Dark loamy duplex
         soils (Dd1.3) and (Dd1.l) occur in the drainage lines and depressions that carry water for long periods after rain
MK2 This unit consists of a complex pattern of relic stream channels and levees but it forms the lower end of a
         delta system and merges into salt pans and mangrove swamps: dominant soils are fine sandy brown earths
         (Gn2.42), with lesser similar red or yellow earths (Gn2.12), (Gn2.15), and (Gn2.22). Minor associated soils
         include organic-surfaced dark duplex soils (Dd1.13) and (Dd1.33) in the wet relic channels, with other
         loamy dark duplex soils (Dd1.33), (Dd1.43), and lesser (Dy2.43) on the areas of marine plain included in
         the unit
ML1 Very gently undulating alluvial plains cut by numerous sharp gullies and old stream levees: dominant soils
         are probably loamy brown earths (Gn2.44) which occur on the levees. Also occurring are loamy brown
         duplex soils (Db1.22), and loamy red earths (Gn2.14) on the old levees. Associated soils include sandy and
         loamy duplex soils of units Va57 and Va78. There are also small areas of dark duplex soils (Dd1.43) in
         minor depressions. Data are limited
MN1 Gently undulating to undulating lands with occasional steep stony rises with granite outcrop: dominant soils
         are moderately deep loamy brown earths (Gn2.45). Associated are moderately deep sandy brown duplex
         soils (Db2.22), yellow duplex soils (Dy2.22), and some moderately deep red earths (Gn2.12). Shallow coarse
         sands (Uc4.1) and (Uc4.21) and sandy duplex soils (Dy2.2) occur on steeper rises and near rock outcrop.
         Data are fairly limited
MN2 Gently undulating to undulating lands, occasionally with some isolated marginal low hills: dominant soils
         are moderately deep loamy brown earths (Gn2.45), with lesser yellow or red earths (Gn2.25) and (Gn2.15).
         Chief associates are shallow loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.22); these are developed on more basic rocks and
         in some areas may be locally dominant. Other loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42), (Dy2.22), and (Dy2.42) occur
         on lower slopes and in drainage lines. Shallow sands, chiefly (Uc4.21) and (Uc2.12) with lesser (Uc4.22)
         and (Uc4.12), occur on ridge crests adjacent to rock outcrop
MO1 Level plains with occasional old sandy infilled channels: dominant soils are deep loamy mottled yellow earths
         (Gn2.61), with lesser similar grey earths (Gn2.81). Also associated are other loamy earths (Gn2.75), (Gn2.95),
         (Gn2.22), (Gn2.21), and (Gn2.62). In the old infilled channels deep sands (Uc5.I 1), (Uc5.21), and (Uc2.22)
         occur, together with some deep sandy grey earths (Gn2.81). In marginal areas there are some loamy duplex
         soils (Dy2.33), (Dy2.13), and (Dy3.33) of unit Si12
MO2 Undulating or gently undulating plains: dominant soils of the middle and upper slopes are loamy or sandy
         mottled yellow earths (Gn2.61 or Gn2.64), with other earths (Gn2.22), (Gn2.44), and (Gn2.94) associated.

         areas of grey cracking clays (Ug5.24), slightly gilgaied yellow friable earths (Gn3.51) and (Gn3.71), and
         loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.43). Occasional small dissected low sandstone hills are included in
         the more western occurrences of the unit. Data are fairly limited
MO3 Gently undulating plains with occasional higher stony ridges: a complex array of soils is present but loamy
         nodular mottled yellow earths (Gn2.61), with lesser (Gn2.64) and (Gn2.74), are probably dominant.
         Closely associated are important areas of loamy or, less commonly, sandy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.14);
         these usually occur on well-defined stream levees. Smaller areas of friable earths (Gn3.71) and (Gn3.91)
         and deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.81) also occur. The higher stony ridges have shallow gravelly duplex soils
         (Dy3.41) and shallow stony loams (Um2.12) and (Um4.1). Data are fairly limited
MO4 Gently undulating to broadly undulating plains with areas of stronger relief where the unit rises to the low
         scarped margins of units Mw52, Mr11, Mr18, Mu17, and MR6: dominant soils are loamy mottled yellow
         earths, almost always with a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at depth; in many areas massive nodular
         laterite outcrops at the surface. The chief soil is (Gn2.61), but (Gn2.64) is often closely associated; less
         common are other nodular loamy earths (Gn2.41, Gn2.44) and (Gn2.21, Gn2.24). Loamy red earths (Gn2.14,
         Gn2.11) occasionally occur on higher sites. Throughout the unit, mostly in lower sites or adjacent to drainage
         lines, there are small areas of the slightly gilgaied yellow or brown friable earths (Gn3.51) and (Gn3.71) of
         unit Mw1, or occasional areas of slightly gilgaied cracking clays (Ug5.26) and (Ug5.33). In shallow drainage
         depressions or swampy areas, which are common in parts of the unit, loamy mottled bleached yellow or
         grey earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.94), grey bleached friable earths (Gn3.04), or loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41),
         (Dy2.84), and (Dg2.41) occur. These soils usually have a horizon of massive nodular laterite at shallow
         depths
MP1 Very gently undulating plains with occasional broad shallow drainage lines; the plains have low scarped
         margins, often with massive nodular laterite exposed: dominant soils are loamy or occasionally sandy
         mottled yellow earths (Gn2.62), usually with a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at depth. Associated
         soils are sandy and loamy yellow earths (Gn2.22), (Gn2.64), and (Gn2.21) and some similar grey earths
         (Gn2.81) and (Gn2.94). Near the margins loamy red earths (Gn2.12) often occur, and adjacent to the
         low scarps are shallow gravelly loams (Um5.51) overlying massive nodular laterite. Small stream levees
         have deep loamy brown or red earths (Gn2.42) and (Gn2.12), while in the shallow drainage lines loamy
         yellow-grey duplex soils (Dy2.12) and (Dy3.41) and loamy and sandy bleached grey earths (Gn2.94) occur
MV1 Very gently undulating alluvial plains with many old stream channels and levees: dominant soils are deep
         sandy mottled yellow earths (Gn2.63), with other sandy earths (Gn2.23), (Gn2.83), and (Gn2.43) associated.
         Lesser neutral sandy earths (Gn2.62) and (Gn2.82) also occur; occasionally these have ironstone nodules
         in the profile. On the sandy rises are deep yellow earthy sands (Uc5.22), with lesser (Uc5.23), (Uc5.21),
         and (Uc5.11)
Mt7 Strongly undulating lands often with granite tor outcrop on higher slopes: a range of loamy mottled yellow
         or grey earths occur, (Gn2.64) is probably dominant but (Gn2.74), (Gn2.84), and (Gn2.94) are also common.
         Moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), (Dy3.21), and (Dy2.21) occur on lower slopes, with shallow

         Minor associated soils include friable yellow earths (Gn3.74) and (Gn3.84) of unit Mf17 and loamy red
         earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.14), which occur on small lateritic mesa remnants
Mt8 Undulating lands with some granite outcrop occurring adjacent to drainage lines: dominant soils on the
         broad ridges are loamy mottled yellow earths (Gn2.64), with (Gn2.61) and (Gn2.24) soils associated. On
         some higher ridges sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.14) occur. On the small exposures of granite are shallow

         and occasionally (Gn2.74). These earths often have a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at depth. On
         some slopes deep sands (Uc4.21) occur, occasionally (Uc4.22), while deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) may
         occur on lower slopes. The occasional sandstone scarps have shallow gravelly and often nodular sands
         (Uc2.12) and (Uc4.21). Throughout the unit adjacent to drainage lines are small sandy plains of unit Ca43
         with deep bleached sands (Uc2.21)
Mb17 Undulating to gently undulating lands with occasional low lateritic scarps and some small level plains:
         dominant soils of the undulating areas are loamy nodular bleached mottled yellow earths (Gn2.74), with very
         similar (Gn2.64) soils closely associated, mostly on the better-drained sites. Massive nodular laterite often
         occurs at shallow depths in the profile. The low lateritic scarps have shallow gravelly and nodular loams
         (Um5.51), with small areas of loamy nodular red, yellow, or brown earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.24), (Gn2.44), and
         (Gn2.54) occurring away from the crest of the scarp. Small level plains occurring throughout the unit have
         loamy yellow-grey duplex soils (Dy3.13) and (Dy3.23), with lesser (Dy3.33), (Dy3.43), and (Dy3.83). Closely

         adjacent to tidal streams, salt-pan soils of unit Io1 are common, and fringing the coast there may be narrow
         sand dunes of unit A20
Mb18 Gently undulating outwash fan plains, often bounded by steep sandstone scarps with moderately undulating
         foot slopes; occasional high stony ridges may also occur: dominant soils are sandy or rarely loamy bleached

         (Gn2.75), (Gn2.94), (Gn2.91), (Gn2.34), and (Gn2.24). Red earths (Gn2.14) are common adjacent to streams.
         In lower sites loamy grey duplex soils (Dy3.41), (Dy3.42), and (Dy3.82) occur. Where the unit is adjacent to
         the sand dunes of unit B36 small plains of deep bleached sands (Uc2.33, Uc2.31) occur. The stony ridges are
         small remnants of unit Tb141
Mb19 Gently undulating or undulating lands with broad ridge crests and shallow drainage depressions: dominant
         soils are loamy or sandy bleached mottled yellow earths (Gn2.74), with similar (Gn2.64) and (Gn2.94) soils
         often closely associated. Most soils have a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at depth and some are nodu-
         lar throughout the profile; massive nodular laterite may occasionally outcrop. On the higher ridge crests
         sandy or loamy red earths (Gn2.14) are common. In the better-defined drainage depressions are sandy or
         loamy grey duplex soils (Dy3.43, Dy3.42), and similar (Dy2) soils. Occasionally in lower sites there may be

         have a prominent ironstone nodule horizon at depth and massive nodular laterite often outcrops on slopes.
         Occurring throughout the unit, particularly in more dissected areas, are gravel-strewn ridges which are
         small inclusions of unit Sd3. The low hills have shallow stony loams (Um4.12) or sands (Uc4.12) and
         (Uc2.12). In lower sites and on small alluvial plains loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.83, Dy3.81) occur.
         In parts of the unit where basic rocks are exposed there may be small areas of red friable earths (Gn3.12,
         Gn3.11)
Mb23 Gently undulating plains; the unit is similar to unit Mb22 but with lesser relief: dominant and associated soils
         are as for unit Mb22 but there are very few inclusions of unit Sd3 and no areas of red friable earths. Loamy

         (Gn2.24), (Gn2.64), and (Gn2.74), and bleached sands (Uc2.21). Most of these soils are underlain by
         weathered sandstone at moderate depths. Occasional higher rises have sandy red earths (Gn2.14). The
         shallow drainage depressions have loamy bleached grey earths (Gn2.94, Gn2.95) and loamy duplex soils
         (Dy2.41, Dy2.42) and (Dy3.43). Adjacent to larger streams are small levees of loamy or sandy red earths
         (Gn2.14). The small dissected mesas are remnants of unit Bz17

         in drainage depressions and on narrow stream flood-plains included in the unit. Shallow bleached sands
         (Uc2.12) occur adjacent to laterite outcrop or where it is within about 24 in. of the surface
MT15 Gently undulating plains: dominant soils are loamy or, less commonly, sandy bleached mottled grey earths,
         chiefly (Gn2.94) but occasionally (Gn2.95, Gn2.91); similar bleached mottled yellow earths (Gn2.74) are
         usually associated. The grey or yellow earths commonly have ironstone nodules at depth. Slightly higher
         rises on the plain and narrow stream levees have loamy or sandy red earths (Gn2.14). In lower sites and in
         drainage depressions loamy duplex soils occur, chiefly (Dy3.43) and (Dy2.43), occasionally (Dy3.41) and

          Most areas have surface stone and all soils have stone within the profile: dominant soils are loamy friable
          red earths (Gn3.12), which are shallow to moderately deep over most of the unit but may occasionally
          be deep. Slightly acid forms (Gn3.11) also occur. Commonly associated are small stony plains of dark
          cracking clays (Ug5.12, Ug5.13) of units Kb24 and Kc1O, and areas of brown friable earths (Gn3.22)
          of unit Me9. The latter occur in slightly depressed sites, chiefly towards the eastern margin of the unit.
          Shallow very stony friable loams (Um6.33) or clays (Uf6.31) are common on the low flow scarps
Mo31 This unit is an association of units Mo30 and Kb24. Overall the loamy friable red earths (Gn3.12) of unit
          Mo30 are dominant but the pattern is very complex. Although there are only few larger areas, there are
          numerous small occurrences of the dark cracking clays (Ug5.12) of unit Kb24. Minor associated soils of
          both units also occur

         porous earths (Gn4.11). Shallow stony loams are common in more stony sites, chiefly (Um6.2), (Um6.4),
         and (Um1.43). At the drier margins of the unit loamy duplex soils occur, chiefly (Dy3.21), (Dy3.41), (Dy3.81),

          of 18 in. Some puffs have a gravel-strewn surface. Closely associated, particularly in lower sites, are small
          areas of slightly gilgaied cracking clays (Ug5.26), (Ug5.33), and (Ug5.22). On upper slopes and on broad

          alluvial plains have (Dr2.21), (Dy2.42, Dy2.43), and occasionally (Ug5.24) soils. The hills bordering the
          unit have shallow stony loams (unit LL16); small areas of these hills may be included in the unit as mapped
Pa4 Extremely stony hills with undulating marginal slopes; the hills consist entirely of piled granodiorite boulders
          with no soil present. The lower marginal slopes have moderately deep, mainly stone-free loamy red duplex
          soils (Dr2.11), with lesser (Dr2.21). On more acid rocks near the margin small areas of (Dy3.41) and (Dy2.21)
          soils occur
Pb27 Extremely steep dissected mountain scarps and steep-sided high hills; rock outcrop may be common:
         dominant are strongly acid loamy duplex soils (Dr2.21), with associated (Dy3.21), (Dy3.41), and similar
         (Db1) soils. Most are shallow and stony. On higher slopes friable earths (Gn3.14) and (Gn3.24) are common,
         with lesser (Gn3.54) and (Gn3.74). Small areas of coarse sandy or Fitty earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.24), and
         (Gn2.44) also occur, and in more stony sites shallow loams (Um4.1) and (Um1.43) are common
Pb30 Gently undulating to undulating lands with some isolated low hilly areas: dominant are shallow to moderately
         deep loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.21). Associated are other loamy duplex soils (Dy2.31), (Dy2.42), and
         (Dy3.42), which occur on lower slopes and in drainage lines. Some shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.21) and
         loams (Um4.2) occur on ridge crests and higher slopes or adjacent to rock outcrop. Also included are
         small areas of deep cracking clays (Ug5.17), and other soils of unit Kb30
Pb31 Low hilly to hilly lands: dominant and associated soils are similar to those of unit Pb30 but the shallow
         gravelly sands (Uc4.21) and loams (Um4.2) are the chief associates. Data are very limited
Pb32 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with occasional low hilly areas: dominant are shallow to moderately
         deep loamy red duplex soils with gravelly A horizons; the most common soil is probably (Dr2.21), but
         neutral forms also occur widely. Associated are similar (Dr2.12, Dr2.11) soils and important occurrences
         of red friable earths (Gn3.12, Gn3.11) on more basic rocks. Areas of stronger relief have shallow stony
         loams (Um4.21) and (Um4.1) and similar (Uc4) soils. Minor areas of yellow duplex soils (Dy3.21), (Dy3.22),
         (Dy2.22), and (Dy3.43) also occur, mostly on lower slopes
Pb33 High hilly lands with very steep slopes and deeply incised minor drainage lines: dominant are moderately
         deep to deep loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.21), with lesser (Dr3.21). The soils have variable amounts of
         coarse detrital gravel throughout the profile. Deep gravelly red earths (Gn2.14) are common on the lower
         colluvial slopes. Shallow loams (Um4.1) and (Um4.21) and occasionally sands (Uc2.12) and (Uc4.22)
         occur on the steeper slopes and adjacent to rock outcrop. A range of loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), (Dy3.43),
         (Dy3.21), and (Dr3.41) occur on lower slopes in areas of lesser relief
Pb34 Gently undulating to undulating lands with some low very rocky granite knolls: dominant are moderately
         deep loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.21), with lesser (Dr2.11). Major and minor associated soils are similar
         to those of unit Mu16
Pb35 Undulating lands with some low hilly areas. The unit is similar to unit Pb32 but is less dissected; ridge crests
         are rounded and long slopes are common: dominant and associated soils are probably the same as unit
         Pb32 but there are greater areas of red friable earths (Gn3.12, Gn3.11). Data are extremely limited
Pb36 Low hilly to hilly lands with steep slopes; schist outcrop is common: dominant soils on higher landscape
         sites are shallow to moderately deep gravelly loamy red duplex soils, chiefly (Dr2.21) but (Dr2.41) and
         (Dr2.61) are commonly associated. On lower slopes similar yellow duplex soils (Dy3.21), (Dy2.21), and
         (Dy3.41) usually occur. On higher rocky hills shallow stony loams (Um4.12) and (Um4.21) occur, and there
         are also small inclusions of granite with shallow bleached sands (Uc2.12) and (Uc2.21)
Pd14 Low hilly lands with undulating marginal slopes: dominant soils are moderately deep loamy red duplex soils
          (Dr2.41), with other duplex soils (Dr2.21) and (Dy3.41) associated. On lesser slopes are small areas of red
          friable earths (Gn3.11, Gn3.14). On higher hills shallow stony loams (Um4.21) occur, and also included in the
          unit are occasional hills of granite with shallow to moderately deep sandy soils (Uc2.21), (Uc2.12), and (Uc4.21)
Pd15 Hilly to low hilly lands, often with igneous rock outcrop: a range of shallow to moderately deep stony
          loamy duplex soils occur but bleached red soils (Dr2.41) are probably most common. Closely associated
          are (Dr3.41) and (Dr2.21) and yellow mottled duplex soils (Dy3.41). On steeper slopes shallow gravelly
          red earths (Gn2.14) and shallow massive red duplex soils (Dr2.61) are common. Moderately deep gravelly
          red friable earths (Gn3.14) occur on areas of more basic rocks
Pf2 High hills with steep marginal slopes and much rock outcrop: dominant are shallow to moderately deep
          gravelly red duplex soils (Dr2.61), with lesser (Dr2.21). Loamy red earths (Gn2.14) and lesser yellow earths

          (Um4.41) and (Um4.12), with some shallow sands (Uc4.12) and loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41) on small
          granite inclusions

          Marginal to the unit topography may be strongly undulating; rock outcrop is common throughout: dominant
          are shallow stony loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.12), with lesser (Dr2.22) and (Dr2.62). Other duplex soils also
          occur, chiefly (Db1.12), (Dy2.22), (Dy2.33), (Dy2.43), and similar (Dy3) soils. Small areas of red friable
          earths (Gn3.12, Gn3.14, and Gn3.15) are associated in some areas. Higher hill crests and more stony sites
          have shallow stony loams (Um1.43), (Um4.1), and (Um2.12) or sands (Uc2.12), (Uc4.1), and (Uc4.2)

          soils (Dy2.21, Dy2.22) are locally dominant. Also often closely associated, particularly on lower slopes,
          are mottled yellow duplex soils (Dy3.42, Dy3.43) and (Dy3.32). The hilly areas have very shallow stony
          duplex soils (Dr2.12), (Dy2.12), and (Db1.12), stony loams (Um1.43) and (Um4.2), or gritty sands (Uc4.2)
          and (Uc2.12). Very occasional small areas of dark clays (Ug5.13) or red-brown clays (Ug5.37) may also be
          included in the unit
Qa17 Strongly dissected hilly lands with short steep slopes and much rock outcrop: dominant are shallow stony
         red duplex soils (Dr2.12), but other duplex soils commonly occur, chiefly (Dy3.42 and Dy2.43). More stony

         Shallow gravelly loams (Um1.43) and (Um5.51) are important associated soils occurring on the steep slopes
         and crests and adjacent to rock outcrop. Some small areas of friable red earths (Gn3. 12) may occur on broad
         crests
Qa20 Undulating to moderately undulating lands with broad crests and slopes and some rock outcrop: dominant are
         shallow to moderately deep gravelly loamy red duplex soils (Dr2. 12, Dr2. 13). Associated soils are moderately
         deep gravel-strewn loamy friable red earths (Gn3.13, Gn3.12) and small areas of cracking clays (Ug5.1,
         Ug5.2, and Ug5.3). Shallow loams (Um5.51) occur near rock outcrop and deep loamy red earths (Gn2.12,
         Gn2. 13) occur on stream levees
Qa21 Undulating or gently undulating lands: dominant are loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.12) of moderate depth.

         flatter sites and lower slopes, are loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.22), (Dy3.32), and (Dy3.42), together with
         similar alkaline forms. Limited areas of dark duplex soils (Dd1.12, Dd1.13) may also occur. On some higher
         ridge crests shallow stony (Dr2.12) soils occur adjacent to rock outcrop
Qa22 Hilly to high hilly lands with some mountainous areas; slopes are very steep and gravelly but there is only
         limited rock outcrop: dominant are shallow to moderately deep loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.12). Associated

Qa25 Strongly undulating to low hilly lands with fairly short slopes: dominant are shallow to moderately deep
         loamy red duplex soils with gravelly A horizons; the most common form is (Dr2.12) with lesser (Dr2.22).
         Similar acid soils also occur widely. The low hilly areas mostly have shallow stony loams (Um4.21) and
         (Um4.1), with lesser similar (Uc4) soils. Red friable earths (Gn3.12, Gn3.11) occur in small areas on more
         basic rocks, and on some lower slopes yellow duplex soils (Dy3.22), (Dy2.22), and (Dy3.43) occur
Qb27  Gently undulating alluvial flood-plains, often with marked terraces, levees, and shallow drainage depressions.
       The dominant soils are those of the older terraces and levees; they have deep sandy or sandy loam A horizons
       (12-24 in.) with a clear change to reddish brown clay or sandy clay. The chief form is (Dr2.22), with
       associated (Dr4.22), (Dy2.22), (Dy2.33), (Dy3.33), (Db1.13), and (Dr2.23). In the shallow drainage
       depressions loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.43) occur, with uniform loams (Um6.11) on the most
       recent terraces which may be subject to flooding
Qb35  Undulating to strongly undulating lands: dominant are loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.22), with (Dr2.12) soils
       commonly associated and occasionally locally dominant. The soils are moderately deep (24 30 in.) and
       normally have quartz gravel throughout the A horizons. Other loamy duplex soils (Dr3.43), (Dy2.23),
       (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), and (Db1) equivalents, together with occasional red friable earths (Gn3.11), occur chiefly
       on the lower slopes. Shallow gravelly loams (Um4.21) or sands (Uc4.21) are common on the higher slopes

       areas of (Dy3.43, Dy3.42), (Dr2.12), and (Dy2.22) soils also occur. Other loamy duplex soils (Db1.23),
       (Db1.43), (Db2.43), (Dy3.32), (Dy3.41), and occasional (Dr3) equivalents occur as minor associates. Loamy
       earths (Gn2.25, Gn2.24) and (Gn2.14) occur on lower outwash slopes and recent alluvium of minor streams.

          yellow-grey duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.42) but with associated (Dy3.42), (Dy3.12), (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), and
          (Dr2.13). The soils have much gravel in the shallow A horizons and usually have ironstone nodules in
          the upper B horizon. Occurring throughout the unit are lower areas of deep grey-brown cracking clays
          (Ug5.24) that may be locally dominant. On the low gravelly rises are very shallow loams (Um1.43),
          (Um2.12), and (Um4.1). Loamy red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.13) occur on stream levees with some yellow
          earths (Gn2.22) at the rear margins of the levees
Sk21 Gently undulating to undulating lands: dominant are shallow to moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dy2.42),
          but closely associated are other loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.43), (Dy3.43), (Dy3.42), (Dr2.22), and
          (Db1.43). Throughout the unit there are numerous small inclusions of the basaltic soils of units Mo31 and
          Kb30, particularly the shallow clays (Uf6.31) and deep cracking clays (Ug5.16)
Sc1 Gently undulating to undulating lands with long slopes and broad crests: dominant are loamy-surfaced duplex
          soils (Dy2.13) with some ironstone nodules in the upper B horizon. Associated are other loamy duplex soils
          (Dy3.13), (Db1.12, Db1.11), (Dr3.42), and (Dr2.13, Dr2.12, Dr2.11). In some depressions are loamy grey
          earths (Gn2.81). Some of the rises have a range of loamy earths (Gn2.22, Gn2.21), (Gn2.44, Gn2.43), and
          (Gn2.12), which have ironstone gravel on the surface and nodules at depth. Some bleached loamy duplex
          soils (Dy2.42) and (Db1.42) may occur near drainage lines. Important areas of grey-brown cracking clays
          (Ug5.24, Ug5.25, and Ug5.22) of unit CH10 occur throughout the unit
Sc2    Gently undulating plains: dominant are deep loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.13, Dy2.12), with lesser
        (Dy3.13), (Dr2.13), and (Db1.12) and loamy yellow and brown earths (Gn2.23) and (Gn2.43). Occurring
        throughout the unit are areas of deep grey-brown cracking clays (Ug5.25, Ug5.24) that may be locally
        dominant
Si10   Level alluvial plains, often with a slight (6 12 in.) gilgai microrelief: dominant are loamy duplex soils with
        mottled and bleached A horizons (6-12 in. deep) overlying dark grey-brown heavy clay (Dy2.33) and
        (Dy2.43). Some similar (Dy3) soils are associated. Where gilgai microrelief is prominent, grey clays (Ug5.24)
        may occupy the puffs. On some more extensive clay plains, cracking clays occupy puff and depression sites.
        Associated in the unit are small areas with very thin-surfaced (2 4 in.) loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and
        (Dy2.33), and also areas of deeper-surfaced sandy duplex soils (Dy3.43) of unit Va57. Where levees of prior
        streams occur in the unit small areas of loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.22) occur
Si12   Level to very gently undulating alluvial plains with numerous anastomosing old infilled channels: dominant
        soils are moderately deep-surfaced loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.33) but (Dy2.13), (Db1.33), (Dy2.43),
        (Dy3.33), (Db1.43), and (Dr2.33) also commonly occur. The chief associated soils in lower sites are massive
        mottled cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4) with, less commonly, (Ug5.24), (Ug5.6), and (Ug5.16), any of
        which may be locally dominant. On the levees the chief soils are stratified loamy brown earths (Gn2.41)
        and loams (Um5.52), with deep sands (Uc5.21) and (Uc5.11), less commonly (Uc2.34) and (Uc2.21),
        occurring on the old infilled channels
Si13  Gently undulating alluvial plains with many old stream levees: dominant are moderately deep-surfaced loamy
        duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.33) but with associated (Dy2.13) and (Dy3.33). Scalded areas occurring on the
        back slopes of the old levees have deep loamy red earths (Gn2.13) and shallow-surfaced loamy duplex soils
        (Dr2.13) and (Db1.13). On the more recent stream levees are deep earthy fine sands (Uc5.21) and earthy
        loams (Um5.52), while sandy red earths (Gn2.14) are common to the older levees. Dark cracking clays
        (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.24) occur in slightly lower areas of the flood-plain. Marginal to the unit are areas of loamy
        mottled grey or yellow earths (Gn2.81), (Gn2.91), and (Gn2.61)
Si14   Alluvial plains fringing major rivers, often traversed by old infilled stream channels and associated low levees:
        dominant soils of the level plains are silty or loamy surfaced grey-brown duplex soils (Dy2.33) that are
        strongly alkaline at shallow depths. Similar brown soils (Db1.33) are closely associated and locally dominant.
        The A horizon depth ranges from 3 to 6 in. and many areas have a scalded surface. Other similar duplex
         soils (Dy3.33), (Dy2.43), (Db1.43), and occasionally (Dr2.43) may occur locally. Small swampy depressions
         and lower plains have grey cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug3.2). Slightly elevated old filled channels and
         associated levees have sandy and loamy red earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15), occasionally (Gn2.16), and lesser
         yellow earths (Gn2.24, Gn2.22) and (Gn2.34). Adjacent to major streams are small lower terraces of uniform
         loams (Um5.52) or sands (Uc5.22). These areas are subject to flooding and the soils are usually stratified
         at depth
Si15 Level alluvial plains with slightly elevated old levees and shallow prior and present stream channels:
          dominant soils of the alluvial plains are loamy grey duplex soils (Dy2.33), with A horizon depth varying
          from 3 to 8 in. Closely associated are other loamy or occasionally sandy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.43)
          but with some areas of similar (Dy3) soils; occasional acid variants may also occur. Sandy red earths
          (Gn2.14) and deep sands (Uc5.11) and (Uc5.21) occupy the stream levees
Sl16 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains: dominant are thin-surfaced (2 4 in.) loamy duplex soils
          (Dy2.43) and (Dy2.33). Similar (Dy3) soils are closely associated but these normally have a deeper A horizon
          (6 10 in.). In some areas a very slight (4 6 in.) gilgai microrelief is present and the puffs may have grey clays
          (Ug5.28, Ug5.29). Locally, slightly gilgaied clay plains (Ug5.28), and less commonly (Ug5.16), may be more
          extensive. Also occurring in small areas are clays (Ug5.28) with a stronger gilgai microrelief (12-18 in.)
Sl31 Level plains with numerous old stream channels: dominant are loamy yellow-grey duplex soils, chiefly
          (Dy2.43) but with (Dy3.43) also common. Associated are other loamy duplex soils (Dy2.33), (Dr2.13),
          and (Db1.13). Near old channels are loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2 12) and (Gn2.21, Gn2.22). Small
          areas of deep grey-brown and brown cracking clays (Ug5.25, Ug5.24) and (Ug5.34, Ug5.35) also occur;
          scalded areas associated with these have shallow-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy2.13), (Dy2.33), and
          (Db1.13)
Sl32 Very gently undulating coastal plains merging into salt pans and mangroves; many relic stream channels
          with low levees occur: dominant soils are loamy grey duplex soils (Dy2.43), some of which have very
          thin (2-4 in.) A horizons. Associated soils are brown earths (Gn2.45) on the low levees and dark duplex
          soils (Dd1.43) and (Dd1.23) in the minor depressions. Saline clays (Uf6.61) occur on the small included
         areas of salt pans
Sl33 Level alluvial plains with some stranded channel meanders: deep-surfaced loamy yellow duplex soils (Dy2.43)
          are most common but other loamy duplex soils are closely associated, chiefly (Dy2.33) and (Dy3.43), with
          lesser (Db1.33). Deep cracking clays (Ug5.17, Ug5.16) and (Ug5.26) are common on the back slopes of
          the flood-plain, particularly on streams draining basaltic country. Deep loamy red earths (Gn2.14) and
          brown earths (Gn2.44) usually occur on the stream levees
Ta11 Undulating to moderately undulating lands with long slopes and occasional steep rises with granite outcrop:
           dominant are moderately deep sandy duplex soils (Dy3.21) and (Dy3.41), often with gravel in the surface.
           Associated are red duplex soils (Dr2.22, Dr2.21) and moderately deep coarse sands (Uc4.2). Shallow coarse
           sands (Uc4.2) and (Uc4.1) occur on steeper rises and near granite outcrop. Other associated soils are sandy
           red or yellow earths (Gn2.11), (Gn2.21), and (Gn2.45), which occur on the very gently undulating lands o,
           the valley floors
Ta12 Low hilly lands with some marginal strongly undulating slopes; granite outcrop is very common: dominant
           soils are shallow stony sandy or loamy duplex soils (Dy3.21), but other duplex soils are closely associated,
           chiefly (Dr2.12), (Dr2.22), (Dr2.62), and (Dr3.21). Shallow stony sands are very common in most rock
           outcrop areas, chiefly (Uc4.2) and (Uc4.11, Uc4.12)
Ta13 Moderately undulating plateau with many low knolls and granite tor outcrop: dominant are moderately
           deep sandy to loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.21). Bleached duplex soils (Dy3.41) are very closely associ-
           ated and in some areas are locally dominant. Also associated are similar neutral duplex soils (Dy3.22) and
           (Dy3.42) and coarse sands, chiefly (Uc2.12) and (Uc4.2), with lesser (Uc2.21, Uc2.23)
Ta14 Alluvial plains with many relic stream channel meanders: dominant are deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.21),
           but there are important areas of deep friable earths (Gn3.74) and (Gn3.94) and smaller areas of deep grey
           cracking clays (Ug5.24). Included also are deep friable loams (Um6.34, Um6.33) of unit Gh1 on the higher
           stream levees and recent alluvium

           (Dy3.31) with lesser (Dy3.41) and areas of gleyed duplex soils (Dg2.31) and (Dg2.41). Deep friable loams
           (Um6.34) of unit Gh1 occur on the slightly higher margins of the swamps and on low stream levees. Deep
           friable earths (Gn3.74), (Gn3.84), and (Gn3.34) occur where the unit lies adjacent to unit LN2
Tb135 Gently sloping plains traversed by numerous creeks; occasional low dunes may occur near the coast: dom-
           inant soils are probably acidic yellow mottled duplex soils (Dy3.41), with similar neutral (Dy3.42) and
           probably alkaline (Dy3.43) soils occurring nearer the coastal margins. Commonly associated are loamy
           and sandy mottled grey earths (Gn2.81) and (Gn2.94), mottled yellow earths (Gn2.62, Gn2.64, and Gn2.61),
           and massive yellow mottled duplex soils (Dy3.81). Adjacent to stream channels are loamy brown earths
           (Gn2.42) and red earths (Gn2.12, Gn2.15). Small isolated areas of heavy grey clay soils (Ug5.2) and (Ug5.5)
           probably occur near the coastal margins associated with salt pans. Various deep (Uc) soils occur on the
           near coastal dunes and on some creek levees. Data are limited
Tb136 Moderately undulating lands with some low hilly to hilly areas; much rock outcrop occurs on higher slopes:
         dominant are shallow to moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), with lesser (Dy3.31) and (Dy3.42)
         and similar (Db2) and (Dy2) soils. Shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.21) and loams (Um4.2) occur on higher
         slopes; the sands may be locally dominant in areas of higher relief. The unit may also include some small
         lateritic mesas with loamy red earths (Gn2.11) on the crests and shallow gravelly loams (Um5.2) on the
         scarps. Data are limited
Tb137 Very gently undulating alluvial coastal plains rising to gentle outwash slopes and low foothills; the plains
         merge into salt pans and mangrove swamps to seaward: dominant are deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41),
         but other duplex soils (Dy3.21), (Dy2.41), and (Dy3.81) and mottled grey (Gn2.94) or yellow (Gn2.74)
         earths are associated. Loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2.14) and (Gn2.24) are common on the gentle outwash
         slopes, and friable earths (Gn3.14), (Gn3.74), and (Gn3.84) of unit Mj1O occur on the low foothills. A range
         of loamy earths, chiefly (Gn2.14), (Gn2.44), and (Gn2.24), occur on the levees of numerous small streams
         traversing the plains. Some low stranded beach ridges of unit AA15 may also be included in the unit
Tb138 Moderately to strongly undulating lands rising to low foothills at the margins of the unit: dominant are
         moderately deep to deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41) but other loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dr3.21) and
         (Dr2.21) but with some (Dy3.31) and (Dy3.21), are common. Some loamy red or yellow earths (Gn2.14)
         and (Gn2.24) occur on higher slopes and outwash fans. Deep friable earths (Gn3.74), (Gn3.84), and
         occasionally (Gn3.14) are common where the unit adjoins unit Mf17. Small areas of deep dark cracking
         clays (Ug5.13, Ug5.15) on basalt or alluvium derived from basalt also occur. Small lateritic mesa remnants
         of units Mr14 and Mw44 are also included

         and fans
Tb140 Undulating lands with some strongly undulating to low hilly areas: dominant are shallow to moderately
         deep loamy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.41). In very close association are other loamy duplex soils (Dr3.21),

         (Um4.23), and (Um2.12) and lesser sands (Uc4.12) are common on the low hilly areas. A range of loamy
         earths including (Gn2.14), (Gn2.24, Gn2.25), and (Gn2.75) occur on the gentle outwash slopes and fans.

         streams
Tb141 Low hilly to hilly lands with fairly short steep slopes; sedimentary rock outcrop is common on ridge crests
         and higher slopes with much detrital gravel on the surface and through the A horizons of the soils:
         dominant are shallow loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41). Major and minor associated soils are similar to those
        of unit Tb140 but with a greater proportion of shallow gravelly loams
Tb142 Level alluvial plains: dominant are moderately deep-surfaced loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), with lesser
          (Dy3.11). The A-B horizon boundary is clear rather than abrupt. Also associated are slightly gilgaied

Tb143 Undulating lands with some isolated low hills; small alluvial plains occur adjacent to larger streams:
          dominant are moderately deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), usually with a clear rather than abrupt change
          to the friable yellow clay B horizons. Associated are other similar duplex soils (Dy2.41), (Dy3.21), (Dr2.41),
          and (Dr2.21) and some loamy yellow earths (Gn2.64) and (Gn2.24). The low hills have shallow stony duplex
          soils (Dy3.41) and (Dr2.41) and shallow stony loams (Um2.12) and (Um2.21). The small alluvial plains have
          deep duplex soils (Dy3.41, Dy3.42, and Dy3.43) with some small levees of red earths (Gn2.14)
Tb144 Alluvial near-coastal plains: dominant are loamy mottled yellow duplex soils (Dy3.41), usually with a clear
          rather than abrupt A-B horizon boundary. Nearer the coast similar neutral (Dy3.42) and (Dy3.82), and

Ua8 Moderately to occasionally strongly undulating lands with some granite outcrop on higher ridge crests:
         dominant soils of the middle and upper slopes are sandy to loamy yellow duplex soils (Dy3.22) and (Dy2.22)
         of shallow to moderate depth and often with gravelly A horizons. On lower slopes and valley floors deeper
         alkaline soils (Dy3.43), (Db1.43), and (Db1.33) occur, often with a scalded surface. Higher ridge crests
         have shallow stony sands (Uc4.21, Uc4.22), (Uc3.21), and (Uc2.12). Gravelly red duplex soils (Dr2.22),
         (Dr2.12), and (Dr2.21) also occur on some upper slopes and flatter ridge crests

         dominant are deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.32), but areas of (Dy2.22) and (Dr2.22) soils also occur. Deep
         alkaline duplex soils (Dy3.43), (Db2.43), and (Db2.33) are common adjacent to drainage lines where there
         are also small areas of deep cracking clay soils of unit Kf11. Minor associated soils include bleached sands

         earths (Gn2.14) are common on the levees of the minor streams, and various deep loamy duplex soils,
         chiefly (Dy3.43), occur on the narrow flood-plains. Included in the unit are numerous small basalt plateau
         remnants with soils similar to those of unit Mo30
Ub104 Low hilly to hilly lands with much rock outcrop: dominant and associated soils are as for unit Ub1O3.
          However, with the stronger topography the soils are shallower and the chief associates are very gravelly
          sands (Uc2.12), with lesser (Uc4.2). Also included are hilly lands with the shallow gravelly leached loamy
          soils of unit Fu20. Data are limited
Ub105 Very gently undulating alluvial plains with some low lateritic rises: deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.42) are
          dominant, but other duplex soils (Dy2.42), (Dy3.32), and (Dy3.43, Dy3.41) are widespread and in some
          areas may be locally dominant. Loamy red earths (Gn2.14) and grey earths (Gn2.94) are common on the
          crests and upper slopes of the low rises, while loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.81) and (Dr3.81) occur on the

Ub106 Undulating lands rising to low foothills: dominant soils are loamy or occasionally sandy duplex soils (Dy3.42).
          with associated yellow earths (Gn2.61) and (Gn2.21, Gn2.24). On lower slopes and small alluvial plains
          alkaline duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy2.43) are common, while small stream levees have loamy red earths
          (Gn2.14). Higher ridges and the low foothills have shallow stony soils of unit Fu25. Data are fairly limited
Ub107 Level alluvial plains, often cut by small distributary stream channels and subject to occasional inundation:
          dominant are loamy or silty mottled yellow-grey duplex soils; a range of reaction trends is present but
          neutral forms (Dy3.42) and (Dy3.32) are probably most common. Closely associated are similar acid duplex
          soils (Dy3.41) and (Dd2.11) and, less commonly, alkaline duplex soils (Dy3.43), (Dy3.33), and (Dy3.13).
          Associated in some lower sites are slightly gilgaied friable mottled yellow earths (Gn3.71, Gn3.73), and
          occasionally deep cracking clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.28). On some slightly higher plains and on old stream
          levees occur loamy yellow earths (Gn2.71, Gn2.74), (Gn2.64), and (Gn2.25). At the northern margin of the
          unit there is a gradual transition to the marine plain clays of unit II12
Ub108 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains with many old sand-filled stream channels and low levees:
          dominant are loamy or sandy bleached duplex soils; neutral forms (Dy3.42), with lesser (Dy2.42), are
          probably most common but alkaline soils (Dy3.43) occur nearer the coast where small areas of slightly
          gilgaied massive grey clays (Ug5.5) may be associated. Also occurring are small areas of deep sandy-surfaced
          gleyed duplex soils (Dg2.8 1, Dg2.82). The old stream channels and levees have deep bleached sands (Uc2.22,
          Uc2.21, and Uc2.23), other sands (Uc4.22, Uc4.21), or sandy red earths (Gn2.14). In the northern extent of
          the unit small areas of grey-brown friable earths (Gn3.92) occur adjacent to larger streams
Ub109 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with occasional low hilly areas; ridge crests are mostly rounded
         with occasional granite outcrop: dominant are sandy or loamy shallow to moderately deep Fitty or gravelly
         mottled duplex soils, usually with a clear rather than abrupt A-B horizon boundary. The chief form is
         probably (Dy3.42), but (Dy3.41), (Dy3.21), (Dy3.22), and (Dy2.21) also occur, together with occasional
         red duplex soils (Dr2.21) and (Dr2.61). The low hills usually have shallow stony sands (Uc4.21) and (Uc4.12)
         or bleached sands (Uc2.12)
Ub110 Very gently undulating alluvial plains and some higher undulating outwash fans: dominant on the plains
         are loamy bleached duplex soils (Dy3.42), with occasional (Dy3.43). Associated on small, slightly higher
         rises are deep-surfaced sandy massive duplex soils (Dy3.81) or deep sandy bleached earths (Gn2.94) and
         (Gn2.74). The higher undulating outwash fans have similar (Dy3 .81 ) soils and deep sandy red earths (Gn2. 14)
Vd4 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains: dominant are duplex soils with fine sandy or loamy A horizons,
         6 10 in. deep. The chief forms are (Dy3.33) and (Dy3.43). Closely associated are slightly lower plains with a
         gilgai complex. The clay puffs are elevated (4 6 in.) and have grey or dark grey clays (Ug5.28) and (Ug5.16).
         Intervening areas have loamy duplex soils (Dy3.33), (Dy3.43), (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), and (Dd1.33); the
         A horizon depth ranges from 4 to 6 in. Also included in the association are smaller, slightly gilgaied clay
         plains with clay-dominant soils (Ug5.16) and (Ug5.28), and some areas of thin-surfaced loamy duplex soils
         of unit Sl16
Vd8 Level alluvial plains often cut by numerous old infilled channels and drainage depressions: dominant are
         moderately deep to deep-surfaced (7-24 in.) loamy to silty duplex soils (Dy3.33) and (Db2.33), with (Dy3.32),
         (Dy2.33), and (Db1.33) also often associated. Also occurring in marginal sites are small areas of loamy
         yellow earths (Gn2.62) and some structured earths (Gn3.05). Associated in lower sites are deep massive
         mottled cracking clays (Ug5.5, Ug5.4, and Ug5.6), with occasionally self-mulching cracking clays (Ug5.28).
         Slightly elevated infilled stream channels have earthy sands (Uc5.21) and (Uc5. 11), bleached sands (Uc2.21 ),
         and some bleached sandy grey earths (Gn2.94). Marginal to the sand-filled channels are deep sandy-surfaced
         duplex soils (Dy3.42), (Dy3.82), and (Dy3.43)
Vd9 Gently undulating alluvial plains and short gently sloping fans and pediments rising to low foothills: dominant
         are sandy or loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy3.33) but with (Dy3.23), (Dy3.43), (Dy2.23), (Dy2.43), (Db1.33),
         and (Db1.43) soils closely associated and in some areas locally dominant. Loamy red or yellow earths
         (Gn2.15), (Gn2.22), and (Gn2.25) occur on the more recent alluvial fans and on stream levees
Va49 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with occasional low hilly areas, often dissected by shallow drainage
         lines; granite tor outcrop may be common: dominant are fairly coarse sandy duplex soils with strongly
         mottled sandy clay subsoils at moderate depths (10 15 in.). Most common form is (Dy3.43) but (Dy3.42)
         and (Dy3.41) also occur. Associated are some areas of similar (Dy2) and (Dy5) soils, and also occurrences
         of gritty gradational soils (Gn2.12) and (Gn2.45). On higher ridges and low hills Fitty stony sands are
         common, chiefly (Uc5.11), (Uc2.12), (Uc4.11), (Uc4.2), and (Uc1.22). Also occurring in the unit,as mapped,
         are small areas of red loamy duplex soils (Dr2.12) and occasionally similar gradational soils (Gn3.12)
Va50 Undulating or gently undulating lands: dominant are sandy or loamy often Fitty duplex soils (Dy3.43), with
          lesser (Dy3.33) and (Dy3.42). Some similar (Dy2) soils also occur. Closely associated, particularly on higher
          landscape sites, are loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.12), rarely (Dr2.13). Small areas of granite outcrop within
          the unit have shallow coarse sands (Uc4.2) and (Uc4.1), less commonly (Uc2.12)
Va57 Very gently undulating alluvial outwash fan plains: dominant are sandy or Fitty duplex soils with moder-
          ately deep (12-15 in.) A horizons. The chief form is (Dy3.43). Associated are small areas of loamy duplex
          soils (Dy2.33) and (Dy2.43) which may have shallower A horizons (units SilO and Sl16). Less commonly,
          deep sandy red duplex soils (Dr2.42) occur, particularly near and on old stream levees
Va74 Undulating lands with occasional massive sandstone outcrop: dominant are moderately deep loamy duplex
          soils, chiefly (Dy3.43) but with other duplex soils (Dy3.33) and (Dr3.33) commonly associated. Adjacent
          to sandstone outcrops are shallow gravelly sands (Uc4.11) and (Uc4.2)
Va75 Gently undulating plains: dominant are loamy or occasionally sandy mottled duplex soils (Dy3.43) and
          (Dy3.33) with moderately deep (6-15 in.) A horizons. Small stream flood-plains have loamy duplex soils
          (Dy2.33) and (Db1.33) with shallower (4-6 in.) A horizons. Slightly higher rises occurring in parts of the
          unit have sandy or loamy yellow earths (Gn2.61, Gn2.64), and (Gn2.21, Gn2.22) or occasionally massive
          duplex soils (Dy3.81). Marginal to unit CB11 are small areas of grey cracking clays (Ug5.22), and adjacent
          to the sandstone mesas of unit JK23 are areas of outwash sand (Uc4.22)
Va76 Alluvial plains with some low stream levees and relic infilled stream channels: dominant are loamy or
          occasionally sandy duplex soils (Dy3.43). Other duplex soils, chiefly (Dy2.43), (Dy3.33), (Dy2.33), (Dd1.33),
          and (Db1.33), are closely associated. The range of soils occurring on the low stream levees and channel
          infills is similar to that described in unit Va78. Also included are some weakly gilgaied areas of unit SilO
Va77 Gently undulating alluvial plains with numerous stream levees and channels. The pattern of soils is similar
          to that of unit Va76 but the sandy duplex soils occupy a greater part of the unit
Va78 Gently undulating to undulating outwash slopes and fans with occasional isolated low hills: dominant on
          the outwash areas are sandy- or gritty-surfaced duplex soils (Dy3.43) with moderately deep (6 12 in.)
          A horizons. Associated duplex soils include (Dy3.33), (Dy3.23), (Dy2.23), (Dy2.43), (Db1.11), (Db1.12),
          and (Dr3.43). Various loamy earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.44), and (Gn2.24) occur on the low stream levees and
          younger fans. Loamy red duplex soils (Dr2.12) are common on the granite hills, with shallow stony loams
          (Um4.1) and (Um4.2) or sands (Uc4.1), (Uc4.2), and (Uc2.12) occurring on other hills
Va79 Undulating to moderately undulating lands with occasional higher strike ridges and low hilly areas: the
         soils vary according to the lithology of the sedimentary rocks, but dominant are shallow sandy to loamy
         duplex soils with A horizons ranging from 4 to 8 in. deep. The chief form is (Dy3.43) but very closely assoc-
         iated are many other duplex soils including (Dy3.41), (Dy3.33), (Dy2.23), (Dy2.43), (Dr2.22), (Dr2.4),
         (Dr3.4), (Dr3.3), (Db1.23), and (Db1.43). Shallow sands (Uc2.12) and lesser loams (Um2.12) are common
         on the higher ridges. All soils have moderate to high amounts of surface gravel with variable amounts
         through the profile. Included are small areas of gilgaied deep cracking clays, with (Ug5. 16) in the depressions
         and (Ug5.2) on the puffs
Va80 Undulating lands with long gentle slopes to fairly broad drainage lines; included in some areas are small
         lateritic mesas: dominant soils are shallow to moderately deep sandy or Fitty mottled duplex soils (Dy3.43).
         A wide range of other duplex soils (Dy3.32), (Dr2.33), (Dr2.43), (Dy2.23), (Dr3.43), and (Db1.23) occur
         on the sloping country, while uniform loams (Um4.2) and loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43) and (Dy3.33) occupy
         the drainage lines. Shallow nodular red or yellow earths (Gn2.15) and (Gn2.25) occur on the low lateritic
         mesas. Data are fairly limited
Va81 Strongly undulating to low hilly lands with many high narrow strike ridges: dominant are shallow gravelly
         sandy or loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43). Associated duplex soils include (Dy3.33), (Dy3.41), and (Dy2) and
         (Dr2) equivalents. Shallow gravelly sands (Uc2.12) and (Uc1.21) are common on higher slopes and ridge
         crests and are associated with much rock outcrop. Data are limited
Va82 High hilly to mountainous lands with very steep slopes and much rock outcrop: dominant are shallow
         gravelly loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43). Very closely associated are shallow sands (Uc4.2) and (Uc1.4), lesser
         (Uc2.12), and loams (Um4.2) and (Um1.42) which occur on higher slopes and adjacent to rock outcrop.
         Other loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41), (Dy2.43), (Dy2.33), (Db1.33), (Dr2.33), and (Dr2.21) occur on lower
         slopes and in minor drainage lines. Loamy red earths (Gn2.11, Gn2.14) occur on the levees and small
         alluvial terraces of the major streams
Va83 Moderately to strongly undulating lands with occasional low hills. The unit has a complex range of soils
         that is closely related to the variable sedimentary rock parent material and to topography: dominant are
         shallow gravelly loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43), but closely associated are other similar duplex soils (Dy3.32),
         (Dy3.22), (Dy2.22), (Dy2.23), (Dy2.32), (Db1.42), (Db2.32), (Db2.33), (Dr2.12), (Dr2.22), (Dr2.23), (Dr2.32),
         and (Dr3.33). Shallow gravelly loams (Um4.2), (Um5.2), (Um2.12), and (Um4.12) and similar sands may
         occur on all landscape sites, but are more common on higher slopes and ridge crests and may be locally
         dominant in areas of stronger relief
Va84 Shallow dissected valley between low lateritic plateaux; numerous low lateritic scarps and mesa remnants
         occur: dominant are moderately deep loamy duplex soils, chiefly (Dy3.43) but with a range of similar soils
         including (Dy2.43), (Dy2.42), (Db1.43), (Db2.43), (Db2.33), (Dr2.22), and (Dr3) equivalents. Loamy red
         or yellow earths (Gn2.14) and (Gn2.24) occur on the lateritic mesas, while shallow gravelly loams (Um4.12)
         and (Um4.21) occur on the low scarps. The alluvium of the valley floor has deep cracking clays (Ug5.15,
         Ug5.17) in the lower back swamp areas and loamy earths (Gn2.14, Gn2.15) and (Gn2.44) on levees and
         recent alluvial terraces. Data are fairly limited
Va85 Level alluvial plains rising to short gently sloping pediments and foot-slopes; some isolated low hilly areas
             are included: dominant are deep loamy or occasionally sandy duplex soils (Dy3.43), with lesser (Dy3.42),
           (Dy3.41), (Dy2.43), (Db2.43), and (Dr3.43). Loamy earths, particularly (Gn2.14) but also (Gn2.44) and
           (Gn2.24), occur on the levees and recent alluvium of the major streams. Included in some areas are very
           small occurrences of gilgaied yellow friable earths (Gn3.53). Shallow stony loams (Um2.12), (Um4.23),
           and (Um4.1) or loamy duplex soils (Dy3.41) are common on the low hills
Va86 Gently undulating outwash slopes and fans: dominant are deep loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43), with closely
           associated deep bleached sands (Uc2.22, Uc2.21). The sands are confined to the relic stream channel infills
           and fans. Minor associated soils include other loamy duplex soils (Dy2.43) and (Dy3.41) and occasionally
           (Dr2.21). Data are limited
Va87 Level or very gently undulating alluvial plains and smaller well-defined drainage depressions originating in
           the northern areas of unit Mr11: dominant are loamy or fine sandy bleached mottled duplex soils; (Dy3.43)
           is most common but other similar duplex soils (Dy3.42), (Dy3.33), (Dy3.83), (Dy3.73), (Dy2.43), and
           (Dy2.42) also are common. Also occurring are loamy bleached grey earths (Gn2.95, Gn2.94) and, in occa-
           sional swampy depressions, slightly gilgaied deep grey clays (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.24). Towards the coastal
           margins of the unit there are small areas of the bleached mottled friable grey earths (Gn3.04) of unit MF10.
           Throughout the unit on the wider alluvial plains there are old stream levees, infilled channels, and small
           sandy rises. These have sandy earths (Gn2.14), (Gn2.24), (Gn2.64), and (Gn2.74) and occasionally deep
           sands (Uc4.22)
Va88 Very gently undulating alluvial plains and smaller well-defined drainage depressions originating in unit
           Mw5O; the wider plains often have many small drainage lines and occasionally low sandy rises: dominant
           are sandy or loamy bleached mottled duplex soils, chiefly (Dy3.43) but with some areas of (Dy3.42) and
           (Dy2.42), occasionally (Dy3.81) and (Dy5.43). The sandy duplex soils often have deep (10-20 in.) A horizons.
           Associated are some bleached grey earths (Gn2.95, Gn2.94). On the more extensive alluvial plains there
           are often low rises with deep bleached sands (Uc2.21) and (Uc2.34) and occasionally small islands of the
           sandy red earths (Gn2.14) of unit Mw5O
HG7 Level alluvial plains that merge seaward into tidal flats, mangrove swamps, and salt pans; the area may be
           inundated for short periods by a combination of flood waters and very high tides, and is often dissected
           by minor stream channels: dominant are silty- or loamy-surfaced duplex soils (Dd1.33) and (Dd1.13).
           At lower levels the B-horizon dark grey clays are strongly mottled (gleyed). Some (Dd2) soils also occur.
           Closely associated in lower depressions and swampy areas are cracking clays (Ug5.24) and (Ug5.16), with,
           less commonly, (Ug5.5) and (Ug5.4). Adjacent to the salt pans saline clays (Uf6.61) may occur, and included
           in the unit, as mapped, are small areas of grey loamy duplex soils (Dy3.43)
HG9 Alluvial plains with some prior stream channels and levees and some stranded low beach dunes; the unit
           merges into salt pans and mangrove swamps. The lower areas are subject to prolonged flooding after heavy
           rains and may also receive some tidal waters: dominant on the flatter marine plains are dark loamy duplex
           soils (Dd1.33) and (Dd1.43), with lesser (Dy2.43). Brown earths (Gn2.42) occur on most levees,
           with deep sands (Uc1.22) on the more recent and higher levees. Deep calcareous sands (Uc1.12) are common
           on the low relic beach ridges
NV2 Gently undulating alluvial plains: dominant are deep sandy gleyed duplex soils (Dg2.41), with similar
           mottled grey duplex soils (Dy3.41, Dy3.42) and (Dy3.21) associated; these are more common in the southern
           extent of the unit. Adjacent to some streams are small lower plains with deep grey-brown friable earths
           (Gn3.91). Also occurring are small sandy outwash fans with deep bleached sands (Uc2.32) or sandy bleached
           grey earths (Gn2.94). Near the adjoining granite hills are low ridges with sandy red earths (Gn2.14) and
           shallow sands (Uc4.22). At the coastal margin the unit grades into mangrove swamps
Z9 Level alluvial plains with some low stream levees and prior stream channels: dominant are deep loamy
           organic soils (O) with a deep strongly structured A horizon. On the slightly elevated stream levees are deep
           friable loams (Um6.34, Um6.33) and (Um4.43) and associated soils of unit Gh1
Z10 Swampy lands inundated for considerable periods of the year: dominant are loamy organic soils (O) with
           some areas of peat. The organic soils have a deep (15-24 in.) strongly structured A horizon overlying gleyed
           clays. Loamy gleyed duplex soils (Dg4.41) and (Dg4.31) and other duplex soils (Dy3.41) and (Dy3.31)
           occur on slightly higher areas. Deep friable loams (Um6.34, Um6.33) of unit Gh1 occur on the levee banks
           of streams and on small areas of higher flood-plain included in the unit
TB Low irregular plateau of highly vesicular basaltic lava (Toomba basalt) in which aa and pahoehoe structures
           and caverns are common. All drainage is subsurface and no soil is developed except for pockets of organic
           debris in rock crevices. Very small areas of stony red earths (unit My37) are mapped with the unit
KB Kinrara basalt--as for unit TB but with small areas of stony friable red earths of unit Mo30 instead of red
           earths of unit My37
B31 Gently undulating sandy plains with very small areas of low bouldery sandstone hills: chief soils are deep
          red and yellow siliceous sands (Uc1.23 and Uc1.22). Associated soils include (Uc2.2), (Uc4.21), (Dy5.42),

          with areas of earthy sands (Uc5.2) and (Gn2) soils, such as (Gn2.13), associated with calcretes (kunkar)
B34 Coastal dune systems generally consolidated but with many mobile areas; sometimes with a central core of
          limestone or ancient coral: chief soils are siliceous sands (Uc1.21 and Uc1.22) but calcareous sands (Uc1.l)
          also occur in places. Other soils are likely where the limestone core has been exposed by erosion. Small
          plains of adjoining units Jw1 or Io1 respectively are included where they occur between dunes. Some
          areas of unit AC15 are included on Groote Eylandt

          southern valleys; and (Gn2.21) soils in narrow northern valleys. Some small inclusions of units AB30 and
          CC59 are likely
BA3 Rugged stony country--ridges, cuestas, and plateaux--formed on sandstone, quartzite, shale, and some
         limestone; rock outcrops are common: chief soils are shallow, often stony, sands and sandy loams (Uc1.43)
         and (Uc4.1), also some loams (Um4.1). There are also small areas of shallow, often stony, (D) soils such
         as (Dr3.21) and (Dy2) on mid and lower slopes; small areas of (Gn2) soils such as (Gn2.1); and (Gn2.2)
         and (Gn2.4) soils occur in inter-ridge areas. Small valleys of various (D) soils such as (Dy2.33), (Db1.43),

          horizons, while plastic clays such as (Uf6.61) may occur in locally wet situations. Small areas of unit NN3
          may be included

         (Um1.3), (Um5.51), and occasionally (Um1.43). Small isolated patches of grey-brown cracking clays
         (Ug5.2) occur with the (Dr) soils. On lower slopes and on some areas of low relief are important areas of

Tb134 Strongly undulating to hilly lands on greywacke, siltstones, and sandstones with rock outcrops, and inter-
            spersed with gently sloping to flat-floored valleys of variable size and extent: soil dominance varies markedly
           between the valleys and the hilly portions. Chief soils of the basal hill slopes and the valleys are hard
           acidic, and also neutral, yellow mottled soils (Dy3.41 and Dy3.42), sometimes with (Dy3.43) and usually in
           association with yellow and grey earths such as (Gn2.24) and (Gn2.95). Chief soils of the hill slopes are
           shallow stony and gravelly loams (Um4.1), (Um1.4) and sands (Uc4.1), (Uc2.12), in association with variable
           areas of stony and gravelly (D) soils such as (Dr2.21), (K-Dy2.21), and (Dr2.51) and yellow earths such as

            dominant soils are probably acidic yellow mottled duplex soils (Dy3.41), with similar neutral (Dy3.42) and
            probably alkaline (Dy3.43) soils occurring nearer the coastal margins. Commonly associated are loamy
            and sandy mottled grey earths (Gn2.81), (Gn2.94), mottled yellow earths (Gn2.62, Gn2.64, and Gn2.61),

            (Ug5.5) probably occur near the coastal margins associated with salt pans. Various deep (Uc) soils occur
            on the near coastal dunes and on some creek levees. Data are limited

             are hard alkaline, hard neutral, and hard acidic yellow mottled and yellow soils (Dy3.43), (Dy3.33),
             (Dy3.42), (Dy3.41), (Dy3.11), and (Dy2.43) in which A horizon thickness varies from < 6 in. to > 12 in.
             in depth; acidic and neutral yellow earths (Gn2.24 and Gn2.25) often containing ironstone gravel, and with
             their sola often overlying either cemented ferruginous layers or dense alkaline clays; and yellow and grey
             leached earths (Gn2.74) and (Gn2.94 and Gn2.95), often containing ironstone gravels. Any of the foregoing
             soils may be dominant on an individual plain; indeed, the plain associated with each stream invariably
             has features peculiar to itself. Other soil occurrences include (Uc1.21), (Uc1.43), (Um5.4), and (Um) and
             (Uf) soils on levees and flats close to streams; and (Dg2.41) and (Dd2.31) soils sometimes associated with
